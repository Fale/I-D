Internet-Draft          Feed Service Managemenet           November 2012


1.  Introduction

   Feed Service Management (FSM) is a decentralized protocol for
   organizing, managing, and persisting client-side state for large
   numbers of feed-based Web services.  This document describes the
   motivations, data models, and protocol interactions for FSM servers
   and clients.  In particular, it specifies how clients create and
   modify service descriptions stored on an FSM server, how they should
   retrieve and use such service descriptions, and how these
   interactions apply across multiple FSM servers, possibly operated by
   completely independent entities.

1.1.  RESTful Web Services

   A growing number of web applications offer APIs and web services, as
   means to share data and interoperate with other services and devices.
   Many such services expose RESTful APIs, with one of the prevalent
   protocols for designing standards-based RESTful APIs being Atom and
   AtomPub.

1.2.  Feed-based Services

   iTunes podcasts, for example, are enclosed audio files delivered as a
   service via feeds, albeit wrapped within the Apple iTunes client.
   Large web content management systems, like Wordpress or Blogger,
   offer full-featured read-write Web services for publishing,
   consuming, and managing content.  In application areas such as the
   Web of Things, a large number of sensors, appliances, and other
   everyday objects may emit data streams, made accessible on the Web as
   real-time data feeds.  Generally speaking, any federated and
   decentralized ecosystem of producers and consumers of information
   services can be modeled as a feed-based architecture.

1.3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


2.  Model

   Feed Service Management provides two fundamental models for managing
   client-side state of feed-based services: Service Entries and
   Bundles.  The Service Entry represents each feed-based service that
   the client is interested in.  The Entry contains information about
   each individual service, including the URI of the service, associated
   metadata, any pre-formulated queries and filters, and other client-



Wilde & Liu               Expires June 3, 2013                  [Page 3]

   side preferences.  Bundles organize one or more Service Entries and
   references to other Bundles into a collection of services, providing
   organization and meta-service entry management features for stored
   services.  Both models are represented in FSM as extensions to the
   Atom specification, with extension elements existing in the namespace
   represented by "http://dret.net/fsm/1.0".

2.1.  Service Entries

   Service Entries are extended Atom entries, representing each service
   that the FSM client is interested in placing with the management
   server.  Each service thus represented MUST have a unique ID, on a
   per client basis.  The URI to the feed-based service MUST appear in
   an href attribute, within the atom:link element that has a rel
   attribute of "alternate", and SHOULD appear in an atom:content
   element as part of the src attribute.  To identify itself as a
   Service Entry, the entry MUST contain an atom:Link element with the
   rel attribute of "profile" and an href to the profile URI
   "http://dret.net/fsm/1.0/service-entry".  Each entry SHOULD also have
   an atom:link element pointing to an edit URI, with a rel attribute of
   "edit", if the entry itself can be edited once placed on the FSM
   server.  Each entry MUST also have an atom:title element, to conform
   with the Atom specification, and MAY place text such as a human-
   readable name of the service in the title element.  Some description
   of the service SHOULD also appear in the atom:summary element of the
   entry.

   If the invocation of the service by this particular client requires
   certain persistent query parameters, these parameters SHOULD appear
   in a fsm:query element.  The fsm:query element accepts an additional
   optional attribute called scheme, which accepts URIs as valid values
   and functions purely as an context identifier for the type of query
   values being preserved within the element.  If the scheme identifier
   is omitted, consumers of the FSM feed MAY assume the contents of the
   fsm:query element to be a valid URI query string component that can
   be directly appended to the service URI.  While the FSM server is
   agnostic to the particular values and semantic meaning of these
   stored values, they may be described by a URI template and template
   description provided by the service itself.

2.2.  Bundles

   Bundles are extended Atom feeds, representing a collection of Service
   Entries or references to other Bundles.  As with normal Atom feeds,
   Bundles MAY be extended with additional metadata, in the form of
   foreign markup.  FSM-specific extensions should exist within the
   namespace identified by the URI "http://dret.net/fsm/1.0".  To
   identify itself as a Bundle, the feed MUST contain an atom:link
   element with the rel attribute of "profile" and an href to the
   profile URI "http://dret.net/fsm/1.0/bundle".  It MUST also identify
   its service document, using an atom:link element with the rel
   attribute of "service".

2.2.1.  Bundle references

   Bundle references are entries within bundles that identify other
   bundles, either hosted locally or on another FSM server.  They are
   Atom entries and resemble Service Entries, except with a profile href
   set to "http://dret.net/fsm/1.0/bundle".  The FSM client can de-
   reference the bundle using the URI given in the entry's alternate
   link element in order to interact with the bundle.

3.  Service Document

   The FSM service document MUST identify each bundle hosted by the FSM
   server as a collection within its workspace, in order to facilitate
   AtomPub service interactions that form the basis of FSM.


4.  Interactions

   Feed Service Management servers MUST implement the AtomPub protocol
   as specified in RFC 5023 [2] for creating and managing feed services.
   The core service interactions are simple and typical AtomPub
   interactions -- the client retrieves the service document, identifies
   the bundles / collections that it is interested in working with, and
   then proceeds with HTTP interactions with the various collections.

4.1.  Services

   To create a new service entry, an FSM client issues a HTTP POST
   request to create a new AtomPub member entry as specified by RFC 5023
   [2] to the URI representing the bundle / collection.  The POST body
   MUST contain an Atom entry representing the service entry to be
   added.  The server signals a successful creation with a status code
   of 201.  The response MUST include a Location header indicating the
   URI of the Service Entry, and a representation of that Entry in the
   body of the response.  Modifying and deleting resources proceed
   exactly as specified in RFC 5023 [2]

   A special case occurs when a bundle reference is being deleted.  In
   this case, the client issues a POST request to the containing
   collection, TODO

4.2.  Bundles

   To create a new bundle, an FSM client must issue a HTTP POST request
   to URI of the desired workspace, as provided by the Atom Service
   Document of the FSM server, containing a collection.  The server
   signals a successful creation with a status code of 201.  The
   response includes a Location header indicating the URI of the bundle
   / collection, and a representation of that Entry in the body of the
   response.  To edit a collection, the FSM client sends a PUT request
   to its Collection URI containing new collection data.  To delete a
   collection, a client sends a DELETE request to its collection URI.

5.  Security Considerations

   Authentication and trust is out of scope of this specification, but
   given this as an extension of Atom and AtomPub standards, security
   considerations outlined in RFC 5023 [2] also applies to the FSM
   protocol.  Standard mitigation strategies for HTTP and Atom
   protocols, such as the use of cryptographic signatures, transport
   layer security, and three-legged authentication protocols like OAuth
   [3] may be applied atop the protocol to address some of these issues.
