1.  Introduction

   Feed Service Management (FSM) is a decentralized protocol for
   organizing, managing, and persisting client-side state for large
   numbers of feed-based Web services.  This document describes the
   motivations, data models, and protocol interactions for FSM servers
   and clients.  In particular, it specifies how clients create and
   modify service descriptions stored on an FSM server, how they should
   retrieve and use such service descriptions, and how these
   interactions apply across multiple FSM servers, possibly operated by
   completely independent entities.

1.1.  RESTful Web Services

   A growing number of web applications offer APIs and web services, as
   means to share data and interoperate with other services and devices.
   Many such services expose RESTful APIs, with one of the prevalent
   protocols for designing standards-based RESTful APIs being Atom and
   AtomPub.

1.2.  Feed-based Services

   iTunes podcasts, for example, are enclosed audio files delivered as a
   service via feeds, albeit wrapped within the Apple iTunes client.
   Large web content management systems, like Wordpress or Blogger,
   offer full-featured read-write Web services for publishing,
   consuming, and managing content.  In application areas such as the
   Web of Things, a large number of sensors, appliances, and other
   everyday objects may emit data streams, made accessible on the Web as
   real-time data feeds.  Generally speaking, any federated and
   decentralized ecosystem of producers and consumers of information
   services can be modeled as a feed-based architecture.

1.3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].
