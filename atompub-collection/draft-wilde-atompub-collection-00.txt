          Creating Collections in the Atom Publishing Protocol
                   draft-wilde-atompub-collection-00

Abstract

   The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) defines, among other concepts,
   how servers expose workspaces and collections, which can then be used
   by clients to engage in further interactions with the server.
   However, AtomPub does not define any protocol mechanism that allow
   clients to manage workspaces and collections, so that clients can
   add, modify, or delete workspaces and/or collections.  This memo
   desribes an extension of AtomPub that allows clients to manage
   workspaces and collections, by adding links and interactions to the
   standard AtomPub protocol.
