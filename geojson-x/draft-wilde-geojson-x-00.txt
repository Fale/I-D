1.  Introduction

   GeoJSON [1] is a geospatial data interchange format based on
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [2].  It defines several types of
   JSON objects and the manner in which they are combined to represent
   data about geographic features, their properties, and their spatial
   extents.
