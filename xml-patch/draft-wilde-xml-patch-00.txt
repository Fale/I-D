                 A Media Type for XML Patch Operations
                        draft-wilde-xml-patch-00

Abstract

   The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch" defines an XML
   document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply
   to an XML document.  The XML Patch document format is defined in RFC
   5261, this specification simply is a media type registration, so that
   XML Patch documents can be labeled with a media type, for example in
   HTTP conversations.

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                 September 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) [1] is a common format for the
   exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [6] extends HTTP
   [7] with a method to perform partial modifications to resources.

   The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch" is an XML document
   structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a
   target XML document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.  It
   also defines an error document structure that allows servers to
   communicate problems within patch documents.

   The formats for the patch and error documents are based on the XML
   Parch Framework defined in RFC 5261 [2].


2.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet media type [3] for an XML Patch Document is application/
   xml-patch.

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: xml-patch

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: none

      Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of
      application/xml as specified in [1].

      Security considerations: This media type has all of the security
      considerations described in [1], plus those listed in Section 3.

      Interoperability considerations: N/A

      Published specification: [[ This document ]]

      Applications that use this media type: Applications that
      manipulate XML documents.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): N/A

         File extension(s): XML data should use ".xml" as the file
         extension.
