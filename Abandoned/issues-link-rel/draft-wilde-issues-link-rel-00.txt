               A Link Relation Type for Issue Management
                     draft-wilde-issues-link-rel-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a link relation for associating resources on the
   Web with other resources that list issues for those resources.  The
   notion of an "issue" is used in a broad sense in this memo.  Issues
   can be bug reports, abuse reports, or any other kind of items that
   are meant to raise awareness and be collected and managed in a
   structured way.  Often, issue management is driven by structured
   workflows, but these workflows and how to represent them are outside
   the scope of this memo.

1.  Introduction

   The concept of identifying "issues" about resources is widely used,
   both on and off the Web and the Internet.  "Issues" can be a variety
   of things, and in its most abstract sense just mean that there are
   some structured notes about a resource, and that these notes
   represent annotations regarding the resource, and often some kind of
   status.

2.  Issues

   In the context of this document, "issues" are considered to be a
   generic class of resources.  They are not limited to the following
   examples of types of issues that resources may be associated with.

Internet-Draft          Issues Link Relation Type           October 2015


2.1.  Bug Reports

   ...

2.1.1.  Examples

      Google, a search engine, has a "Send feedback" link at the bottom
      of search result pages, which uses a text input and screenshot in
      order to accept bug reports or comments.

2.2.  Abuse

   Abuse of a service may fall into a wide variety of categories.  Some
   categories may be common to many online resources: unsolicited
   commercial messages (spam); online harassment or violent threats;
   impersonation or violations of privacy; copyright or trademark
   infringement.  Other categories may be more specific to the norms of
   a particular service or the violation of the rules of a particular
   community: "doxxing"; uncited or unverified information; off-topic
   postings.

2.2.1.  Examples

      Facebook, a social network, has "Report post" menu items on post
      and photo pages, which prompt an interactive set of questions
      (typically implemented through AJAX dialogs) for reporting
      problems including rudeness, harassment, violent threats, sexually
      explicit content and spam.

      Tumblr, a blog host, has a dedicated abuse reporting web page [3],
      with categories for harassment, privacy violations, promotion of
      self-harm, impersonation, misattribution of content, hate speech,
      "gross" content, or any violation of Community Guidelines.  As
      part of the form, users are asked to provide the URL of the
      abusive content.  The abuse reporting page is not linked or easily
      accessible from hosted blog posts themselves.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].
