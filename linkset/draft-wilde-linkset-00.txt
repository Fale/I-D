      Linkset: A Link Relation Type and Media Types for Link Sets
                         draft-wilde-linkset-00

Abstract

   This specification defines a link relation type and media types for
   working with sets of links.  Using this link relation type and/or the
   media types is useful when it becomes necessary to represent links
   outside the context of a resource they are linking.  One example are
   scenarios in which the number of links to put in an HTTP Link header
   field is too big, and thus these links should become a resource of
   their own.

1.  Introduction

   Resources on the Web often convey typed Web Links [RFC5988] as a part
   of resource representations, for example, using the <link> element
   for HTML representations, or the "Link" header field in HTTP response
   headers for representations of any media type.  In some cases,

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                       June 2017


   however, providing links by value is impractical or impossible.  In
   these cases, an approach to provide links by reference (instead of by
   value) can solve the problem.  This specification defines the
   "linkset" relation type that allows to link resources to sets of
   links, thereby making it possible to represent links by reference,
   and not by value.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This section introduces two types of resources involved in providing
   links by reference, as well as the link relation type used to
   interlink them.

2.1.  Origin Resource

   An "origin resource" is a resource that makes links in which it
   participates discoverable by providing a typed link that has a "link
   set resource" as the target.  From the perspective of the origin
   resource, the links in the "link set resource" are therefore provided
   by reference.

2.2.  Link Set Resource

   A "link set resource" is a resource - distinct from the origin
   resource, and possibly linked to from the origin resource - that
   provides one or more links in which the origin resource participates.

   Because the link set resource is distinct from the origin resource,
   links provided by the link set resource must represent both the
   source and target of each link to allow unambiguous interpretation.

   Link set resources can be represented in any way that allows
   representation of links in a way that supports both source and target
   anchors of links.  Section Section 5 defines two possible
   representations, both of which are based on the link model introduced
   by Web Linking [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].

3.  Scenarios

   The following sections outline some scenarios in which it is useful
   to have the ability to separate resources and links pertaining to
   them.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                       June 2017


   These are all scenarios in which providing (some) links by reference
   is advantageous or necessary to accomplish certain goals.  It is
   important to keep in mind that even when using the pattern of "links
   by reference", it is still possible to provide links by value,
   allowing resources to decide and combine which of the two patterns
   they would like to use.

3.1.  Third-Party Links

   In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to an origin
   resource are provided by a server other than the one that hosts the
   origin resource.  For example, this allows:

   o  Providing links in which the origin resource is involved not just
      as source but also as target.

   o  Providing links pertaining to the original resource that the
      server hosting that resource is not aware of.

   o  External management of links pertaining to the origin resource in
      a special-purpose link management service.

   In such cases, a third-party link set resource provides links
   pertaining to the origin resource.  This link set resource may be
   managed by the same custodian as the origin resource, or by a third
   party.

   In order for the server hosting the origin resource to provide an up-
   to-date and complete set of links for it, it would need to obtain the
   links from the link set resource, and embed them in the origin
   resource's representations prior to responding to a client.  Doing so
   would increase latency and load, which may be unnecessary if a client
   is not intent on consuming these links.  Providing links by
   reference, instead of by value, removes the server-to-server
   communication and resulting overhead required to obtain links.
   Instead, the consumer of the origin resource can decide if they need
   the additional links as context for the resource.

3.2.  Challenges Writing Links in Header

   In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP
   Link header from an application.  This can, for example, be the case
   because not all required link information is available to the
   application or because the application does not have the capability
   to directly write HTTP headers.  In such cases, providing links by
   reference can be a solution because a link to a link set pertaining
   to a resource can typcially be added by means of a web server rewrite
   rule that leverages the resource's URI.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                       June 2017


3.3.  Large Number of Links

   When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, it is possible for
   the size of the HTTP response header to become unpredictable.  This
   can be the case when links are determined dynamically dependent on a
   range of contextual factors.  It is possible to statically configure
   a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by
   specifying an upper boundary for their size.  But when the number of
   links is unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is
   challenging.

   HTTP [RFC7231] defines error codes related to excess communication by
   the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI
   Too Long"), but no specific error codes are defined to indicate that
   a response header exceeds the upper boundary that can be handled by
   the server, and thus it has been truncated.  As a result,
   applications take counter measures aimed at controlling the size of
   the HTTP "Link" header, for example by limiting the links they
   provide to those with select relation types, thereby limiting the
   value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients.  Providing links by
   reference, instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the
   unpredictable nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" headers.

   In more extreme scenarios it is conceivable that the number of links
   pertaining to the origin resource becomes so large that the response
   from the associated link set resource becomes too large.  This could
   be the case for highly popular origin resources, when the link set
   includes incoming links as well.  In such cases, the link set
   resource could deliver responses incrementally, for example, using a
   paged resource model that clients could consume as required.

4.  The "linkset" Relation Type for Linking to Link Sets

   A link with the "linkset" link relation type has as Context IRI the
   IRI of an origin resource, and as Target IRI the IRI of an associated
   link set resource.

   A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header
   and/or the body of the origin resource's representation.  It may also
   be discovered by other means, such as through client-side
   information.

   More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided.
   Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed
   using different representations, or to different link sets
   (potentially provided by different services).

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                       June 2017


   The use of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude
   the provision of links with other relation types, i.e. the origin
   resource can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link.
   Therefore, the effective set of links pertaining to the origin
   resource is the union of the links that the resource itself provides,
   and of all links in which it participates which are provided by the
   link set resources linked from it via "linkset" links.

   The link set resource MAY provide the links that pertain to the
   origin resource in its HTTP response header and/or body:

   o  In cases whereby the link set resource provides these links in its
      Link HTTP response header, the payload of that header MUST comply
      with the syntax defined in Web Linking [RFC5988].  The media type
      of the response body is not constrained.

   o  In cases whereby the link set resource provides these links in its
      response body, the body SHOULD allow a client to determine the
      source and target of each provided link.  The media type of the
      response body is otherwise not constrained.

   There is no constraint on the Target IRI of a link with the "linkset"
   relation type; designing and using these links is left to the
   discretion of implementers.

   If an origin resource provides a "linkset" link pointing at a link
   set resource, and that link set resource provides a "linkset" link in
   turn, then this latter link points at links pertaining to the link
   set resource.  This means that in the context of the latter link, the
   link set resource is an origin resource.  This also means that
   linkset relations are not transitive; it is up to a client to decide
   whether they follow "chains" of linkset links or not.

5.  Document Formats for Link Sets

   This section specifies two document formats to convey link sets, one
   that is identical to the payload of the HTTP Link header as specified
   in [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis], the other a JSON-based format that
   does not have the character encoding limitations to which HTTP
   headers are subject as per [RFC5987].

5.1.  Native Document Format for Link Sets: application/linkset

   This document format is identical to the payload of the HTTP Link
   header.  It is defined in Section 3 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis],
   more specifically by its ABNF production rule for "Link" and
   subsequent ones.  The media type for this format is application/
   linkset.

5.2.  JSON Document Format for Link Sets: application/linkset+json

   The JSON-based format for a link set document is defined by the
   "links" production rule and subsequent ones from the ABNF in
   Figure 1.  The media type for the format is application/linkset+json.

links = begin-array link *( value-separator link ) end-array
link = begin-object link-target *( value-separator link-param ) end-object
link-target = quotation-mark "href" quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark URI quotation-mark
link-param = quotation-mark link-param quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark relation-types quotation-mark
link-param = ( ( quotation-mark "rel" quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark relation-types quotation-mark )
             | ( quotation-mark "anchor" quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark URI quotation-mark )
             | ( quotation-mark "rev" quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark relation-types quotation-mark )
             | ( quotation-mark "hreflang" quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark Language-Tag quotation-mark )

             | ( quotation-mark "type" quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark media-type quotation-mark )
             | ( quotation-mark link-extension-attribute quotation-mark name-separator quotation-mark unquoted-string quotation-mark )
             | ( link-extension ) )
relation-types = relation-type *( ws relation-type )
relation-type  = reg-rel-type | ext-rel-type
reg-rel-type   = LOALPHA *( LOALPHA | DIGIT | "." | "-" )
ext-rel-type   = URI
link-extension-attribute = unquoted-string
unquoted-string = *char


      Figure 1: ABNF that defines the application/linkset+json format

   The ABNF includes production rules from other specifications, as
   follows:

   o  From [RFC7159]: begin-array , end-array , begin-object , end-
      object , value-separator , name-separator , ws , quotation-mark ,
      char

   o  From [RFC5987]: Language-Tag

   o  From [W3C.REC-html401-19991224]: media-query-list

   o  From [RFC3986]: URI

6.  Examples

   Sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 show examples whereby the link
   set resource provides links pertaining to the origin resource, in its
   response header and body, respectively.

   In this example, the IRI of the linkset resource does not directly
   represent the IRI of the origin resource anymore.  There still is an
   association possible through a IRI pattern that is including DOI
   information, but as in the example above, the linkset IRI is opaque
   to the client which simply accesses the IRI to retrieve the linkset
   resource.

   Figure 8 shows the client issuing an HTTP GET request against the

       Figure 9: Response to HTTP GET against the Link Set Resource

   If Figure 7 would have provided a link to a link set with media type
   application/linkset, and if the client would have requested that link
   set, then the body of the response would have been similar to
   Figure 9.  But it would have had application/linkset as Content-Type,
   the payload of the HTTP Link header of Figure 5 as body, and an
   accordingly adjusted value for Content-Length.

   Section 6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [RFC5988]:

      Relation Name: linkset

      Description: The Target IRI of a link with the "linkset" relation
      type provides a set of links that pertain to the Context IRI of
      the link.
