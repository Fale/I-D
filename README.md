Internet-Drafts
===============

Internet Drafts I've authored or contributed to. All are works-in-progress, except for the following ones: "Abandoned" contains drafts I'm no longer pursuing; "Published" contains those that made it to RFC status.

For individual draft status, see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/{draft_name}/

For a status summary, see http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search/?rfcs=on&activeDrafts=on&oldDrafts=on&by=author&author=Wilde

Giving Feedback
---------------

If the draft you want to make a comment on specifies an e-mail list for feedback, please use this address. Usually, it's in the abstract.

Otherwise, feel free to either [contact me via e-mail](mailto:dret@berkeley.edu), or to open an issue on GitHub.

Collaborating
-------------

Feel free to fork this repository and issue pull request (which I might or might not choose to accept). The source is always the XML of the latest version, and HTML/TXT versions are generated using [the old version of xml2rfc](http://xml.resource.org/old.html). The HTML/TXT versions may be outdated, so always check the dates on the XML and HTML/TXT versions. Please do not push HTML/TXT, I will update those occasionally, but not necessarily with every update of the XML.

Some drafts may use [XInclude](http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/) to include files, in which case I usually use [XIPr](../XIPr). But you can use any XInclude processor you like. If a draft uses XInclude, it should be mentioned in somewhere near the start in a comment, you will probably see a processing instruction for XIPr, and you will find [XInclude XML elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#syntax) somewhere in the draft's XML source.
