Internet-Drafts
===============

Internet Drafts I've authored or contributed to. All are works-in-progress, except for the following ones: "Abandoned" contains drafts I'm no longer pursuing; "Published" contains those that made it into an RFC.

For individual draft status, see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/{draft_name}/

For overall status, see http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search/?rfcs=on&activeDrafts=on&oldDrafts=on&by=author&author=Wilde

Giving Feedback
---------------

If the draft you want to make a comment upon specifies an e-mail list for feedback, please use that. Usually, it's in the abstract.

Otherwise, feel free to either [contact me via e-mail](mailto:dret@berkeley.edu), or to open an issue on github.

Collaborating
-------------

Feel free to fork this repository and issue pull request (which I might or might not choose to accept). The source is always the XML of the latest version, and HTML/TXT versions are generated using [the old version of xml2rfc](http://xml.resource.org/old.html). The HTML/TXT versions may be outdated, so always check the dates on the XML and HTML/TXT versions. Please do not push HTML/TXT, I will update those occasionally, but not necessarily with every update of the XML.
