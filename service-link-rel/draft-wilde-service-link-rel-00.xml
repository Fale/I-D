      <abstract>
         <t>Many resources provided on the Web are part of a sets of resources that are provided in a context that is defined and managed by one particular service provider. Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs". This specification defines two link relations that allows to represent relationships from those resources to ones that provide documentation or descriptions of the Web services. The difference between these concepts is that documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers.</t>

      <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
         <t>One of the defiing aspects of the Web is that it is possible to interact with Web resources without any specific prior knowledge of the specific of the resource. By using URIs, HTTP, and media types, the Web's uniform interface allows interactions with resources without the sometimes considerably more complex binding procedures of other approaches.</t>
         <t>However, many resources on the Web still are provided as part of some set of resources that often are referred to as a "Web Service" or a "Web API". In many cases, these services or APIs are defined and managed as a whole, and it may be desirable for clients to be able to discover this information.</t>
         <t>Service definition can be separated into two broad categories: One category is entirely targeted for human users and often uses generic formats or human readable documents, such as HTML or PDF. The other category is structured information that followed some more formalized description model, and is intended for consumption my machines, for example for tools and libraries.</t>
         <t>In the context of this specification, the human-oriented variant is referred to as "documentation", and the machine-oriented variant is referred to as "description".</t>
         <t>These two categories are not always mutually exclusive, as there are numerous formats that have been proposed that are intended for both human consumption, and for interpretation by machine clients.</t>
         <t>This specification makes no assumptions about the specific formats used for either of those two categories. It simply assumes that the publisher of a resource may want to make the documentation and/or the description discoverable, and defines two link relations that serve that purpose.</t>
