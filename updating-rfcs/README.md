# Updating RFCs

As part of document metadata, RFCs can reference existing RFC that they update or obsolete. While obsoleting is well-understood (replace the obsoleted RFC in its entirety), updating has more nuances because the updated RFC remains valid. This document contains some clarifications about how to handle updating in a way that makes it easier for readers to understand how the original and the updating RFC relate.
