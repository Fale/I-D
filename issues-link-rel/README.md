# A Link Relation Type for Issue Management

This memo defines a link relation for associating resources on the Web with other resources that list issues for those resources. The notion of an "issue" is used in a broad sense in this memo. Issues can be bug reports, abuse reports, or any other kind of items that are meant to raise awareness and be collected and managed in a structured way. Often, issue management is driven by structured workflows, but these workflows and how to represent them are outside the scope of this memo.
