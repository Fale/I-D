         <t>This memo defines a link relation for associating resources on the Web with other resources that list issues for those resources. The notion of an "issue" is used in a broad sense in this memo. Issues can be bug reports, abuse reports, or any other kind of items that are meant to raise awareness and be collected and managed in a structured way. Often, issue management is driven by structured workflows, but these workflows and how to represent them are outside the scope of this memo.</t>

      <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
         <t>The concept of identifying "issues" about resources is widely used, both on and off the Web and the Internet. "Issues" can be a variety of things, and in its most abstract sense just mean that there are some structured notes about a resource, and that these notes represent annotations regarding the resource, and often some kind of status.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Issues" anchor="issues">
         <t>In the context of this document, "issues" are considered to be a generic class of resources. They are not limited to the following examples of types of issues that resources may be associated with.</t>
         <section title="Bug Reports" anchor="bugs">
            <t>...</t>
            <section title="Examples">
              <t>
                <list>
                  <t>Google, a search engine, has a "Send feedback" link at the bottom of search result pages, which uses a text input and screenshot in order to accept bug reports or comments.</t>
                </list>

         <section title="Abuse" anchor="abuse">
            <t>Abuse of a service may fall into a wide variety of categories. Some categories may be common to many online resources: unsolicited commercial messages (spam); online harassment or violent threats; impersonation or violations of privacy; copyright or trademark infringement. Other categories may be more specific to the norms of a particular service or the violation of the rules of a particular community: "doxxing"; uncited or unverified information; off-topic postings.</t>
            <section title="Examples">
              <t>
                <list>
                  <t>Facebook, a social network, has "Report post" menu items on post and photo pages, which prompt an interactive set of questions (typically implemented through AJAX dialogs) for reporting problems including rudeness, harassment, violent threats, sexually explicit content and spam.</t>
                  <t>Tumblr, a blog host, has a dedicated <eref target="https://www.tumblr.com/abuse">abuse reporting web page</eref>, with categories for harassment, privacy violations, promotion of self-harm, impersonation, misattribution of content, hate speech, "gross" content, or any violation of Community Guidelines. As part of the form, users are asked to provide the URL of the abusive content. The abuse reporting page is not linked or easily accessible from hosted blog posts themselves.</t>
