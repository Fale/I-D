               A Link Relation Type for Issue Management
                     draft-wilde-issues-link-rel-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a link relation for associating resources on the
   Web with other resources that list issues for those resources.  The
   notion of an "issue" is used in a broad sense in this memo.  Issues
   can be bug reports, abuse reports, or any other kind of items that
   are meant to raise awareness and be collected and managed in a
   structured way.  Often, issue management is driven by structured
   workflows, but these workflows and how to represent them are outside
   the scope of this memo.
