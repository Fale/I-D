                       URI Template Descriptions
                      draft-wilde-template-desc-00

Abstract

   Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by and/or can
   be described by URI Templates.  RFC 6570 says that "a URI Template is
   a compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform
   Resource Identifiers through variable expansion."  This specification
   defines Template Descriptions, a schema and a media type that can be
   used to document and describe a URI Template by supporting
   descriptive markup that allows variables to be associated with
   documentation (human-oriented) and/or descriptions (machine-
   oriented).  Template Descriptions can be used by media types (by
   inclusion or by reference) that seek to make URI Templates self-
   describing, without having to create their own representation.

Internet-Draft          URI Template Descriptions          December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Simple interactions with resources on the Web often are driven by
   simply following links, but in many other cases, interactions with
   resources require clients to provide information in addition to just
   using a fixed URI in a request.  In these cases, information can
   provided in any way supported by the interaction protocol, and in
   case of HTTP, this often means that information is either embedded in
   the URI, and/or in the body of the request.  For the first case, the
   "URI Template" standard Section 1.1 provides a standard that allows
   servers and clients to exchange information about the URIs that a
   service accepts.

1.1.  URI Template

   The "URI Template" standard RFC 6570 [1] specifies "a compact
   sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource
   Identifiers through variable expansion."  It allows servers to
   publish their expectation how a URI should be created by substituting
   variables with values.  Consider the following URI Template:
   http://www.example.com/feed{?pagesize,page}

   This URI Template allows clients to expand two variables to end up
   with a concrete URI such as the following:
   http://www.example.com/feed?pagesize=10&page=42

   URI Templates cover the aspect of starting with a template with
   variables in it, assigning values to these variables, and then
   expanding the template into a URI that can be used for sending a
   request.  URI Templates make no assumptions or statements about the
   value range of the variables, except for those aspects which are
   required to cover the process of expanding the template.  In
   particular, for the example given above, there is no indication that
   the values are supposed to be positive integers (the simple data
   type), nor is there any indication that the service may apply certain
   limits such as a maximum page size (which may change depending on
   which paged resource is being accessed).  As a side note, even if
   this information was known, URI template expansion could still result
   in URIs that would not yield successful requests, such as when asking
   for a page that is beyond the number of pages that a feed has (in a
   given page size).

   The goal of Templates Descriptions as defined here is to allow
   servers to expose a description resource that provides support both
   at development time (when a developer looks at a media type that uses
   URI Templates) and at runtime (when a client wants to use a URI
   template as part of its application flow).

1.2.  Describing Variables

   Variables can be described in a variety of ways when using Template
   Descriptions.  For each variable in the URI Template, it is possible
   to use the following description methods:

      Domain Concept:

      Datatype: XML Schema Part 2 [2]

      Documentation: XML Schema Part 1 [3]

      Application Information: XML Schema Part 1 [3]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

4.2.  Link Relation

      Relation Name: query-template

      Description: Linking to a resource that can be used as a template
      description for creating a request URI for the context resource.

      Reference: [[ This document ]]

      Notes: Template Descriptions can be used in all scenarios where
      clients want to create requests that represent a query into the
      context resource.  The media type of the context resource and the
      media type of the template description resource are not
      constrained by this specification.


5.  Security Considerations

6.  Examples

   ...

6.1.  OpenSearch

   ...

6.2.  Atom Feeds

   ...

   "Feed Paging and Archiving" specified in RFC 5005 [7]

   Maybe suggest to use profiles?


7.  Open Issues

      If and how to use profiles (example in Section 6); if profile use
      is recommended, define a suggested profile URI for other specs to
      use?

      Should we support other ways how URIs could be generated, most
      importantly the application/x-www-form-urlencoded method of HTML
      forms?

      How to handle variables in Level 4 templates that are supposed to
      have composite values?
