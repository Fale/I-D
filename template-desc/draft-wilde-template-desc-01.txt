                       URI Template Descriptions
                      draft-wilde-template-desc-01

Abstract

   Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by and/or can
   be described by URI Templates.  RFC 6570 says that "a URI Template is
   a compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform
   Resource Identifiers through variable expansion."  This specification
   defines Template Descriptions, a schema and a media type that can be
   used to document and describe a URI Template by supporting
   descriptive markup that allows variables to be associated with
   documentation (human-oriented) and/or descriptions (machine-
   oriented).  Template Descriptions can be used by media types (by
   inclusion or by reference) that seek to make URI Templates self-
   describing, without having to create their own representation.

Internet-Draft          URI Template Descriptions          February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Simple interactions with resources on the Web often are driven by
   simply following links, but in many other cases, interactions with
   resources require clients to provide information in addition to just
   using a fixed URI in a request.  In these cases, information can be
   provided in any way supported by the interaction protocol, and in
   case of HTTP, this often means that information is either embedded in
   the URI, and/or in the body of the request.  For the first case, the
   "URI Template" standard Section 1.1 provides a standard that allows
   servers and clients to exchange information about the URIs that a
   service accepts.

1.1.  URI Template

   The "URI Template" standard RFC 6570 [1] specifies "a compact
   sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource
   Identifiers through variable expansion."  It allows servers to
   publish their expectation how a URI should be created by substituting
   variables with values.  Consider the following URI Template:
   http://www.example.com/feed{?pagesize,page}

   This URI Template allows clients to expand two variables to end up
   with a concrete URI such as the following:
   http://www.example.com/feed?pagesize=10&page=42

   URI Templates cover the aspect of starting with a template with
   variables in it, assigning values to these variables, and then
   expanding the template into a URI that can be used for sending a
   request.  URI Templates make no assumptions or statements about the
   value range of the variables, except for those aspects which are
   required to cover the process of expanding the template.  In
   particular, for the example given above, there is no indication that
   the values are supposed to be positive integers (the simple data
   type), nor is there any indication that the service may apply certain
   limits such as a maximum page size (which may change depending on
   which paged resource is being accessed).  As a side note, even if
   this information was known, URI template expansion could still result
   in URIs that would not yield successful requests, such as when asking
   for a page that is beyond the number of pages that a feed has (in a
   given page size).

   The goal of Templates Descriptions as defined here is to allow
   servers to expose a description resource that provides support both
   at development time (when a developer looks at a media type that uses
   URI Templates) and at runtime (when a client wants to use a URI
   template as part of its application flow).

Internet-Draft          URI Template Descriptions          February 2013


1.2.  Describing Variables

   Variables can be described in a variety of ways when using Template
   Descriptions.  For each variable in the URI Template, it is possible
   to use the following description methods:

      Domain Concept: It is possible to associate a variable with a
      domain concept, so that media types and applications can make an
      association between the concepts they are defining/exposing, and
      how they are represented in URI Templates.  Concepts can be
      referred to by URI, or by using a QName [2].

      Datatype: Variables can be described in terms of using certain
      datatypes, and the datatype vocabulary is that of XML Schema Part
      2 [3], plus all of the applicable facets of those datatypes.  This
      allows Template Descriptions to constrain the set of allowed
      values.

      Documentation: Documentation constructs can be associated with
      variables, which allows Template Descriptions to attach human-
      readable information to individual variables.  The documentation
      constructs use the documentation design of XML Schema Part 1 [4].

      Application Information: Application information constructs can be
      associated with variables, which allows Template Descriptions to
      attach machine-readable information to individual variables.  The
      application information constructs use the application information
      design of XML Schema Part 1 [4].

   For the purpose of this specification, the term "description" should
   be interpreted loosely.  Some aspects of descriptions can be formal,
   such as the datatypes of variables.  Thus, such a description can be
   used to drive general-purpose logic that knows nothing but this
   specification.  However, for most other description aspects (domain
   concepts, documentation, and application information), this
   specification does not prescribe a description framework; it simply
   provides a structure how to deliver these descriptions.

   The descriptions of "domain concepts" and "datatypes" are not
   mutually exclusive.  On the contrary, a domain concept often will
   have associated constraints that essentially define a datatype.  The
   difference is that while domain concepts are only described by
   identifier (allowing a consumer to identify a domain concept that
   they know about), datatypes are described with a built-in vocabulary
   (XSD datatypes and their facets), allowing clients to interpret the
   datatype description.  As a consequence, when a consumer encounters
   an unknown domain concept, it adds little to the knowledge of the
   consumer, whereas a datatype description can always be interpreted

   and allows the consumer to learn about constraints of the associated
   variable.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].


3.  Template Descriptions

   Template Descriptions are based on a URI Template, and add
   descriptive elements that allow publishers of URI Templates to
   describe the URI Template as a whole, and to add individual
   descriptions of all variables in the template.

3.1.  General Concepts

   As mentioned in Section 1.1, most of the descriptions in this spec do
   not prescribe a specific description framework.  While variables
   (Section 3.3) can be described with a built-in vocabulary of
   datatypes, most other descriptions are either for human consumption,
   or do rely on some external description framework.  To attach these
   descriptions to both the template as a whole, and individual
   variables, this specification reuses the "appinfo" and
   "documentation" elements from XML Schema Part 1 [4].  These elements
   carry a "source" attribute which is used (quoting from [4]) "to
   supplement the local information."

3.2.  Template Description Structure

   A template is described by including the URI Template itself, and
   optionally adding documentation and/or appinfo elements to add human-
   or machine-readable descriptions.

3.3.  Variable Description Structure

   A variable is described by specifying the variable name.  Variables
   can refer to a "concept" associated with a variable, which can by
   identified by URI, or by a QName (at most one of these SHALL be
   present).  This specification makes no provision how such a concept
   is defined or described, but it allows consumers of a Template
   Description to match their understanding of certain concepts to those
   identifiers, which then establishes a binding between the concept,
   and the variable it has been bound to.

   Variable descriptions can optionally add documentation and/or appinfo
   elements to add human- or machine-readable descriptions.


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Media Type

   The Internet media type [9] for a Template Description document is
   application/td+xml (using the "+xml" suffix as defined and registered
   by RFC 6839 [10]).

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: td+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: profile

         ...

      Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of
      application/xml as specified in [6].

      Security considerations: This media type has all of the security
      considerations described in [6], plus those listed in Section 5.

      Interoperability considerations: N/A

      Published specification: RFC XXXX

      Applications that use this media type: Applications that publish
      descriptions of URI Templates.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): none

         File extension(s): XML data should use ".xml" as the file
         extension.

         Macintosh file type code(s): TEXT

4.2.  Link Relation

   The link relation type below will be registered by IANA per Section
   6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [7]:

      Relation Name: query-template

      Description: Linking to a resource that can be used as a template
      description for creating a request URI for the context resource.

      Reference: RFC XXXX

      Notes: Template Descriptions can be used in all scenarios where
      clients want to create requests that represent a query into the
      context resource.  The media type of the context resource and the
      media type of the template description resource are not
      constrained by this specification.

7.  Open Issues

      If and how to use profiles (example in Section 6); if profile use
      is recommended, define a suggested profile URI for other specs to
      use?

      Should we support other ways how URIs could be generated, most
      importantly the application/x-www-form-urlencoded method of HTML
      forms?

      How to handle variables in Level 4 templates that are supposed to
      have composite values?

      Should there be some way how default values can be exposed/
      documented?

      If a template is refined in an incremental process (such as for
      example faceted search services), does it make sense to be able to
      add a "back" link and/or "home" link, so that clients can find the
      "most general" version easily?

      How does this interact with "faceted search" scenarios?  Does
      incremental refinement of URI Template Descriptions somehow nicely
      and naturally map into faceted search scenarios?

      Is there a concept of how Template Descriptions (and thus URI
      Templates) can be reused?  Should there be an inclusion facility
      or something along those lines?  If so, what's the model for that?
      Initial thoughts on possibilities can be found on this page [14]


8.  Change Log

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

8.1.  From -00 to -01

   o  Added more open issues.

   o  Added profile media type parameter.

   o  Added a lot of descriptive text about the purpose, the concepts,
      and the goals.
