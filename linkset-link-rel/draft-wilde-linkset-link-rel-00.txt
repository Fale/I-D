1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] specifies the HTTP "Link" header as a means to
   convey typed links in HTTP responses.  The links are provided as the
   payload of the "Link" header using a syntax specified by the RFC.
   Cases exist in which providing links by value is impractical or
   impossible.  In these cases, an approach to provide links by
   reference is desired.  This specification defines the "linkset"
   relation type that allows doing so.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.1.  Large Number of Links

   Cases exist in which a significant number of links needs to be
   conveyed, and, as a result, the payload of the HTTP "Link" header
   becomes large.  It is possible to statically configure a web server
   to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by specifying an
   upper boundary for their size.  But, when the number of links and the
   amount of bytes required for each is unpredictable estimating a
   reliable upper boundary is challenging.  This is, for example, the
   case when links are determined dynamically dependent on a range of
   contextual factors.  Applications take counter measures aimed at
   controlling the size of the HTTP "Link" header, for example, by
   limiting the links they provide to those with select relation types,
   thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients.
   Providing links by reference, instead of by value, overcomes
   challenges related to the unpredictable nature of the extent of HTTP
   "Link" headers.

4.2.  Third-Party Links

   Cases exist in which a server other than the responding server is
   better placed to provide links.  That other server - the linking
   server - may be managed by the same custodian as the responding
   server or by a third party trusted by the custodian of the responding
   server.  In both cases, the linking server exposes links pertaining
   to web resources made available by the responding server.  In order
   for the responding server to provide up-to-date links in the HTTP
   "Link" header, it needs to obtain them from the link server prior to
   responding to a client.  Doing so increases latency, which may be
   unnecessary if a client is not intent on consuming links.  Providing
   links by reference, instead of by value, removes this additional
   latency by avoiding server-to-server communication required to obtain
   links.

5.  Link Relation for Identifying Link Sets

   The "linkset" relation type can be used to refer to a resource that
   provides a set of links.  Typically the Context IRI of these links is
   the URI of the responding resource but other Context IRIs MAY be
   used.

   More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided.
   Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed
   using different serializations or to different sets of links.  The
   use of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude the
   provision of links with other relation types.

Internet-Draft         Linkset Link Relation Type          November 2016


   The entity-body of a response from the Target IRI of a link with the
   "linkset" relation type MAY be serialized in various ways, but the
   link-value format serialization described here MUST be supported.  In
   this serialization, the entity-body MUST be formatted in the same way
   as the value of an HTTP "Link" header, and hence MUST comply to the
   "link-value" construction rule of Section 5 of RFC 5988 [RFC5988],
   and the media type of the entity-body MUST be "application/link-
   format" as introduced in RFC 6690 [RFC6690].  The Context IRI of
   links contained in the entity-body MUST be interpreted as follows:

      The Context IRI is the URI in the anchor parameter, when provided.

      The Context IRI is the URI of the resource that conveys the link
      with the "linkset" relation type, when the anchor parameter is not
      provided.

   For self-containdeness, the use of anchors for all links is
   RECOMMENDED.

5.1.  Example

   Figure 1 shows a user agent issuing an HTTP head request against
   resource http://example.org/resource1.


   HEAD /resource1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Connection: close


             Figure 1: User Agent Issues HTTP HEAD on Resource

   Figure 2 shows the response to the HEAD request of Figure 1.  The
   response contains a "Link" header with a link that uses the "linkset"
   relation type.  It indicates that links are provided by a linking
   server at resource http://example.com/links/http://example.org/
   resource.

   Figure 3 shows the user agent issuing an HTTP GET request against the
   Target IRI of the link with the "linkset" relation type shown in
   Figure 2.


   GET /links/http://example.org/resource1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   Figure 4 shows response by the linking server to the HTTP GET request
   of Figure 3.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per
   Section 6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [RFC5988]:

6.1.  Link Relation Type: linkset

      Relation Name: linkset

      Description: The Target IRI of a link with the "linkset" relation
      type provides a set of links.
