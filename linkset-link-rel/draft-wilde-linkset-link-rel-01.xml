        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t>A resource typically conveys typed Web Links <xref target="RFC5988"/> as an inherent 
                 part of the resource's representation <xref target="RFC7231"/>, for example, using the &lt;link&gt; 
                 element for HTML representations or the "Link" header in HTTP response headers for representations 
                 of any media type. Cases exist in which providing links in a by value manner is impractical or impossible. 
                 In these cases, an approach to provide links by reference is desired. 
                 This specification defines the "linkset" relation type that allows doing so.</t>

              <section title="Third-Party Links" anchor="third-party">
                <t>Cases exist in which a resource other than the responding resource is better placed 
                to provide web links. That other resource is hosted by a link server that may be managed by 
                the same custodian as the responding resource or by a third party. In order for the 
                responding server to provide up-to-date links about its resource, 
                it needs to obtain them from the link server, and embed them in the resource's 
                representation prior to responding to a client. 
                Doing so increases latency, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on 
                consuming links. Providing links by reference, 
                instead of by value, removes this additional latency by avoiding server-to-server 
                communication required to obtain links.
                </t>

            <section title="Large Number of Links" anchor="link-volume">
                <t>When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, cases exist in which the size of the HTTP 
                response header becomes unpredictable. This is, for example, the case when links are determined 
                dynamically dependent on a range of contextual factors. It is possible to statically configure 
                a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by specifying an upper boundary 
                for their size. But, when the number of links and the amount of bytes required for each is 
                unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is challenging. While HTTP 
                <xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref> defines error codes related to excess communication 
                by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too Long"), 
                no error codes are defined to indicate that a response header exceeds  the upper boundary that can 
                be handled by the server. As a result, applications take counter measures aimed at controlling 
                the size of the HTTP "Link" header, for example, by limiting the links they provide to those 
                with select relation types, thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients. 
                Providing links by reference, instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the unpredictable 
                nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" headers.

        <section title="Link Relation for Linking to Link Sets" anchor="linkset-link-relation">
            <t>The "linkset" relation type can be used by a responding resource to refer to 
            another resource that provides a set of links. Typically the Context IRI of these links  
            is the URI of the responding resource but links with other Context IRIs MAY be provided. 
            </t>
            <t>The media type of the link set that is accessible via the Target IRI of a link with the 
            "linkset" relation type is not constrained but the representation of the link set MUST allow 
            a user-agent to unambiguously determine the Context IRI of each provided link.  
            </t>
            <t>More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided. 
            Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed using different 
            representations or to different link sets. The use of a link with the "linkset" relation 
            type does not preclude the provision of links with other relation types.

             <t><xref target="Response1.1"></xref> shows the response to the HEAD request of 
             <xref target="Request1"></xref>. The response contains a "Link" header with 
             a link that uses the "linkset" relation type. It indicates that links are provided 
             by another resource http://example.com/links/http://example.org/resource, which 
             has media type application/link-format [<xref target="RFC6690"/>]. Using this 
             media type, links are serialized in the same manner as the payload of the "Link" 
             header, which lowers the barrier for user-agents that are already able to consume 
             HTTP links.
