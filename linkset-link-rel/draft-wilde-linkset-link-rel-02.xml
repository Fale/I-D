            <t>A hypermedia resource typically conveys typed Web Links <xref target="RFC5988"/> as an inherent 
                 part of the resource's representation <xref target="RFC7231"/>, for example, using the &lt;link&gt; 
                 element for HTML representations, or the "Link" header field in HTTP response headers for representations 
                 of any media type. Cases exist in which providing links by value is impractical or impossible. 
                 In these cases, an approach to provide links by reference is desired. 
                 This specification defines the "linkset" relation type that allows doing so.</t>

                <t>A "link" relates resources by virtue of connecting them in a way that is meaningful to applications. Links can have any number of participating resources, but in most scenarios on the Web, and in popular link models, they often have exactly two participating resources. In addition, links almost always have directionality, meaning that participating resources play roles in a link and the link is intended to be traversed in a particular way.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Source Resource" anchor="source-resource">
                <t>For directional links (i.e., the vast majority of links on the Web and in link models), the "source resource" is a resource that is intended to be the start point of link traversal. Depending on the scenario, the source resource can be a URI-identified resource, or it can be a fragment of a URI-identified resource.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Target Resource" anchor="target-resource">
                <t>For directional links (i.e., the vast majority of links on the Web and in link models), the "target resource" is a resource that is intended to be the end point of link traversal. Depending on the scenario, the source resource can be a URI-identified resource, or it can be a fragment of a URI-identified resource.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Link Anchor" anchor="link-anchor">
                <t>A "link anchor" is any resource that is participating in a link. In directional link models, a resource can be anchored as "source resource" or as "target resource". While this matters in terms of how a link is intended to be traversed, both roles have the same fundamental meaning that the resource is participating in a link.</t>

            <section title="Linked Resource" anchor="linked-resource">
                <t>Any resource that is participating in a link (as "source resource" or as "target resource") is a "linked resource". When attempting to understand how a resource is participating in links (i.e., how it is linked), its participation in links as both "source resource" and "target resource" roles is significant.</t>

              <section title="Third-Party Links" anchor="third-party">
                <t>Cases exist in which a service other than the one providing a resource is expected 
                to provide links for that resource. This "third-party link resource" is hosted by a link server that may be managed by 
                the same custodian as the responding resource, or by a third party. In order for the 
                responding server to provide up-to-date and complete links about its resources, 
                it would need to obtain them from the link server, and embed them in the resource 
                representations prior to responding to a client. 
                Doing so increases latency and load, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on 
                consuming links. Providing links by reference, 
                instead of by value, removes this additional latency by avoiding server-to-server 
                communication required to obtain links.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Large Number of Links" anchor="link-volume">
                <t>When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, cases exist in which the size of the HTTP 
                response header becomes unpredictable. This is, for example, the case when links are determined 
                dynamically dependent on a range of contextual factors. It is possible to statically configure 
                a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by specifying an upper boundary 
                for their size. But when the number of links and the amount of bytes required for each is 
                unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is challenging. While HTTP 
                <xref target="RFC7231"/> defines error codes related to excess communication 
                by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too Long"), 
                no error codes are defined to indicate that a response header exceeds the upper boundary that can 
                be handled by the server. As a result, applications take counter measures aimed at controlling 
                the size of the HTTP "Link" header, for example, by limiting the links they provide to those 
                with select relation types, thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients. 
                Providing links by reference, instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the unpredictable 
                nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" headers.</t>

        <section title="Link Relation for Linking to Link Sets" anchor="linkset-link-relation">
            <t>The "linkset" link relation type is used by a resource to link to 
            a resource that provides a set of links. Typically the Context IRI of these links  
            is the URI of the responding resource but links with other Context IRIs MAY be provided.</t>
            <t>The media type of the link set that is accessible via the Target IRI of a link with the 
            "linkset" relation type is not constrained, but the representation of the link set MUST allow 
            a user-agent to unambiguously determine the Context IRI of each provided link.</t>
            <t>More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided. 
            Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed using different 
            representations, or to different link sets. The use of a link with the "linkset" relation 
            type does not preclude the provision of links with other relation types, i.e. it is possible for a resource to combine both inline and out-of-line links.</t>

             <xref target="Request1"/>. The response contains a "Link" header with 
             a link that uses the "linkset" relation type. It indicates that links are provided 
             by another resource http://example.com/links/http://example.org/resource, which 
             uses the media type application/link-format <xref target="RFC6690"/>. Using this 
             media type, links are serialized in the same manner as the payload of the "Link" 
             header, which lowers the barrier for user-agents that are already able to consume 
             HTTP links.

                   For most (but not all) links, the Context IRI is the resource that provided the link with the "linkset" relation type,
