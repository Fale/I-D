1.  Introduction

   Resources on the Web often convey typed Web Links [RFC5988] as an
   inherent part of resource representations [RFC7231], for example,
   using the <link> element for HTML representations, or the "Link"
   header field in HTTP response headers for representations of any
   media type.  Cases exist in which providing links by value is
   impractical or impossible.  In these cases, an approach to provide
   links by reference (instead of by value) is desired.  This
   specification defines the "linkset" relation type that allows doing
   so.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This section introduces two types of resources involved in providing
   links by reference, as well as the link relation type used to
   interlink them.

Internet-Draft         Linkset Link Relation Type              June 2017


2.1.  Origin Resource

   An "origin resource" is a resource that makes links in which it
   participates discoverable by providing a typed link that targets a
   "link set resource".

2.2.  Link Set Resource

   A "link set resource" is a resource - distinct from the "origin
   resource" - that provides one or more links in which the origin
   resource participates.

   Because the link set resource is distinct from the origin resource,
   links provided by the link set resource must represent both the
   source and target of each link as a means to allow unambiguous
   interpretation.

3.  Scenarios

   The following sections outline some scenarios in which it is useful
   to have the ability to separate resources and links pertaining to
   them.

3.1.  Third-Party Links

   In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to an origin
   resource are provided by a server other than the one that hosts the
   origin resource.  For example, this allows:

   o  Providing links in which the origin resource is involved not just
      as source but also as target.

   o  Providing links pertaining to the original resource that the
      server hosting that resource is not even aware of.

   o  External management of links pertaining to the origin resource in
      a special-purpose service.

   In such cases, a third-party link set resource provides links
   pertaining to the origin resource.  This link set resource may be
   managed by the same custodian as the origin resource or by a third
   party.

   In order for the server hosting the origin resource to provide up-to-
   date and complete links about it, it would need to obtain the links
   from the link set resource, and embed them in the origin resource's
   representations prior to responding to a client.  Doing so increases
   latency and load, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent

   on consuming links.  Providing links by reference, instead of by
   value, removes the server-to-server communication required to obtain
   links.

3.2.  Large Number of Links

   When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, cases exist in which
   the size of the HTTP response header becomes unpredictable.  This can
   be the case when links are determined dynamically dependent on a
   range of contextual factors.  It is possible to statically configure
   a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by
   specifying an upper boundary for their size.  But when the number of
   links is unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is
   challenging.

   HTTP [RFC7231] defines error codes related to excess communication by
   the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI
   Too Long"), but no specific error codes are defined to indicate that
   a response header exceeds the upper boundary that can be handled by
   the server, and thus it has been truncated.  As a result,
   applications take counter measures aimed at controlling the size of
   the HTTP "Link" header, for example by limiting the links they
   provide to those with select relation types, thereby limiting the
   value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients.  Providing links by
   reference, instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the
   unpredictable nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" headers.

   In more extreme scenarios it is conceivable that the number of links
   pertaining to the origin resource becomes so large that the response
   from the associated link set resource becomes too large.  This could
   be the case for highly popular origin resources.  In such cases, the
   link set resource could deliver responses incrementally, for example,
   using a paged resource model that clients could consume as required.

4.  The "linkset" Relation Type for Linking to Link Sets

   A link with the "linkset" link relation type has as Context IRI the
   IRI of an origin resource, and as Target IRI the IRI of an associated
   link set resource.

   A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header
   and/or the body of the origin resource's representation.

   More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided.
   Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed
   using different representations, or to different link sets
   (potentially provided by different services).

Internet-Draft         Linkset Link Relation Type              June 2017


   The use of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude
   the provision of links with other relation types, i.e. the origin
   resource can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link.
   Therefore, the effective set of links pertaining to the origin
   resource is the union of the links that the resource itself provides,
   and of all links in which it participates which are provided by the
   link set resources linked from it via "linkset" links.

   The link set resource MAY provide the links that pertain to the
   origin resource in its HTTP response header and/or body:

   o  In cases whereby the link set resource provides these links in its
      Link HTTP response header, the payload of that header MUST comply
      with the syntax defined in [RFC5988].  The media type of the
      response body is not constrained.

   o  In cases whereby the link set resource provides these links in its
      response body, the body MUST allow a client to unambiguously
      determine the source and target of each provided link.  The media
      type of the response body is otherwise not constrained.

   There is no constraint on the Target IRI of a link with the "linkset"
   relation type; designing and using these links is left to the
   discretion of implementers.  However, it is assumed that an
   unambiguous association with the origin resource that provides the
   link to the Target IRI can be derived.

   If an origin resource provides a "linkset" link pointing at a link
   set resource, and that link set resource provides a "linkset" link in
   its turn, then this latter link points at links pertaining to the
   link set resource, i.e. in the context of the latter link, the link
   set resource is an origin resource.

5.  Examples

   Sections Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 show examples whereby the link
   set resource provides links pertaining to the origin resource, in its
   response header and body, respectively.

5.1.  Links Provided in the Header of the Link Set Resource

   Figure 1 shows a client issuing an HTTP head request against origin
   resource http://example.org/resource1.

   Figure 2 shows the response to the HEAD request of Figure 1.  The
   response contains a Link header with a link that has the "linkset"

   Figure 4 shows the response headers to the HTTP GET request of
   Figure 3.  The links pertaining to the origin resource are provided
   in the Link response header of the link set resource.  As can be
   seen, in order to support an unambiguous determination of the Context
   IRI of each link, the "anchor" attribute is provided for each link.
   Note that most, but not all, links have the origin resource as
   Context IRI (anchor).
