         <t>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links, and these links often define certain expectations about the interactions (such as HTTP methods being used, media types being sent in the request, or URI parameters being used in a certain way). While these expectations are essential to define the possible framework for interactions, it may be useful to further narrow them down by providing link descriptions, which can help clients to gain more runtime knowledge about the resource they are about to interact with.</t>
         <t>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by and/or can be described by URI Templates. RFC 6570 says that "a URI Template is a compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource Identifiers through variable expansion." This specification defines Template Descriptions, a schema and a media type that can be used to document and describe a URI Template by supporting descriptive markup that allows variables to be associated with documentation (human-oriented) and/or descriptions (machine-oriented). Template Descriptions can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek to make URI Templates self-describing, without having to create their own representation.</t>

      <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
         <t>Interactions with resources found on the Web often are driven by following links, which can be either fixed links <xref target="intro-links"/>, or can be templated links containing variables <xref target="intro-templates"/>. In both cases, the context of the link in most cases provides information that can be essential or helpful when it comes to interacting with a link: For fixed links, the context may specify allowed interaction methods (such as HTTP verbs) or expectations around the expected media type in requests; for templated links, the context additionally may provide information about how to instantiate the variables provided in the URI Template. This memo defines a schema and a media type that can be used to (partially) represent this information, so that it becomes possible represent a change in interaction affordances at runtime.</t>
         <t>Possible use cases for both scenarios (fixed and templated links) are as follows:</t>
         <t>
            <list>
               <t>Fixed Links: AtomPub <xref target="RFC5023"/> defines an "edit" link relation, that tells clients that a link can be followed to read, update, or delete a resource. This means that a client just encountering such a link would conclude that it can try to read, update, or delete the linked resource. However, if the resource is not deletable, then a "edit" link could be annotated to indicate that the linked resource cannot be deleted. A client could ignore the annotation and still attempt to delete the resource, but the request would be likely to fail (unless the state of the resource changed in the meantime). This kind of information can be very useful for UIs, where it can be used to drive usability features such as disabling certain operations.</t>
               <t></t>
            </list>

         <section title="Web Links" anchor="intro-links">
            <t>"Web Linking" <xref target="RFC5988"/></t>

         <section title="URI Template" anchor="intro-templates">
            <t>In many cases, interactions with resources require clients to provide information in addition to just repeating a fixed URI in a request. In these cases, information can be provided in any way supported by the interaction protocol, and in case of HTTP, this often means that information is either embedded in the URI, and/or in the body of the request. For the first case, a "URI Template" <xref target="RFC6570"/> provides a standard that allows servers and clients to exchange information about the URIs that a service accepts. The standard specifies "a compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource Identifiers through variable expansion." It allows servers to publish their expectation how a URI should be created by substituting variables with values. Consider the following URI Template:</t> 
            <figure>
               <artwork>http://www.example.com/feed{?pagesize,page}</artwork>
            </figure>
            <t>This URI Template allows clients to expand two variables to end up with a concrete URI such as the following:</t>
            <figure>
               <artwork>http://www.example.com/feed?pagesize=10&amp;page=42</artwork>
            </figure>
            <t>URI Templates cover the aspect of starting with a template with variables in it, assigning values to these variables, and then expanding the template into a URI that can be used for issuing a request. URI Templates make no assumptions or statements about the value range of the variables, except for those aspects which are required to cover the process of expanding the template. In particular, for the example given above, there is no indication that the values are supposed to be positive integers (the simple data type), nor is there any indication that the service may apply certain limits such as a maximum page size (which may change depending on which paged resource is being accessed). As a side note, even if this information was known, URI template expansion could still result in URIs that would not yield successful requests, such as when asking for a page that is beyond the number of pages that a feed has (in a given page size).</t>
             <t>The goal of Templates Descriptions as defined here is to allow servers to expose a description resource that provides support both at development time (when a developer looks at a media type that uses URI Templates) and at runtime (when a client wants to use a URI template as part of its application flow). Template Descriptions are intended to provide additional information that is not communicated by publishing URI Templates alone. The additional information is both targeted at machines and at humans. On the human-oriented Web, a Template Description can be seen as the equivalent of a help or documentation page that is linked to from a form, where users can learn more about the values they are supposed to submit within the form.</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Describing Variables" anchor="intro-variables">
            <t>Variables can be described in a variety of ways when using Interaction Descriptions. For each variable contained in the URI Template, it is possible to use the following description methods:</t>
            <t>
               <list>
                  <t>Concept: It is possible to associate a variable with a concept, so that media types and applications can make an association between the concepts they are defining/exposing, and how they are exposed in URI Templates. Concepts can be referred to by using a URI as an identifier. This specification defines no interactions with this URI identifier and makes no assumption about possible representations, should this URI be dereferncable and yield some representation.</t>
                  <t>Datatype: Variables can be described in terms of using certain datatypes. The datatype vocabulary is that of XML Schema Part 2 <xref target="XSD-2"/>, plus all of the applicable facets of those datatypes. This allows Interaction Descriptions to constrain the set of allowed values. (This model does not cover any "co-constraints", i.e. dependencies across variables, or between variables and externally defined values.)</t>
                  <t>Documentation: Documentation constructs can be associated with variables, which allows Interaction Descriptions to attach human-readable information to individual variables. The documentation constructs use the documentation design of XML Schema Part 1 <xref target="XSD-1"/>. XML Schema's documentation model has the ability to support multi-lingual human-oriented documentation.</t>
                  <t>Application Information: Application information constructs can be associated with variables, which allows Interaction Descriptions to attach machine-readable information to individual variables. The application information constructs use the application information design of XML Schema Part 1 <xref target="XSD-1"/>.</t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>For the purpose of this specification, the term "description" should be interpreted loosely. Some aspects of descriptions can be formal, such as the datatypes of variables. Thus, such a description can be used to drive general-purpose logic that knows no additional framework other than this specification. However, for most other description aspects (concepts, documentation, and application information), this specification does not prescribe a description framework; it simply provides a structure how to deliver these descriptions.</t>
            <t>The descriptions of "concepts" and "datatypes" are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, a concept often will have associated constraints that essentially define a datatype. The difference is that while concepts are only described by identifier (allowing a consumer to identify a concept that they know about), datatypes are described with a built-in vocabulary (XSD datatypes and their facets), allowing clients to interpret the datatype description. As a consequence, when a consumer encounters an unknown concept, it adds little to the knowledge of the consumer, whereas a datatype description can always be interpreted and allows the consumer to learn about constraints of the associated variable.</t>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
         <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Interaction Descriptions" anchor="interaction-desc">
         <t>Interaction Descriptions are based on a URI Template, and add descriptive elements that allow publishers of URI Templates to describe the URI Template as a whole, and to add individual descriptions of all variables in the template. The idea of Interaction Descriptions is that they are made available at design time and/or at runtime, so that clients encountering URI Templates as part of HTTP services can find more information about the template itself.</t>
         <t>Ideally, every URI template exposed in an HTTP service should be accompanied by a link to a Interaction Description. In those XML-based HTTP services where URI Templates are exposed in XML attributes named "hreft", the suggestion is to add a link to the corresponding Interaction Description in an "href-id" XML attribute.</t>
         <section title="General Concepts" anchor="concepts">
            <t>As mentioned in <xref target="intro-templates"/>, most of the descriptions in this spec do not prescribe a specific description framework. While variables (<xref target="variable-struct"/>) can be described with a built-in vocabulary of datatypes, most other descriptions are either for human consumption, or do rely on some external description framework. To attach these descriptions to both the template as a whole, and individual variables, this specification reuses the "appinfo" and "documentation" elements from XML Schema Part 1 <xref target="XSD-1"/>. These elements carry a "source" attribute, which is used (quoting from <xref target="XSD-1"/>) "to supplement the local information." For example, when a description of a variable is done formally using a specific description framework, this would best translate to use appinfo elements, and to add an identifier to them which would identify the description framework in question. As a result, any client knowing this particular description framework would be able to interpret the variable description in the Interaction Description.</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Interaction Description Structure" anchor="interaction-desc-struct">
            <t>An interaction is described by including the URI Template itself, and optionally adding documentation and/or appinfo elements to add human- or machine-readable descriptions.</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Variable Description Structure" anchor="variable-struct">
            <t>A variable is described by specifying the variable name. Variables can refer to a "concept" associated with a variable, which can by identified by URI. This specification makes no provision how such a concept is defined and/or described/documented, but it allows consumers of a Interaction Description to match their understanding of certain concepts to those identifiers, which then establishes a binding between the concept, and the variable it has been bound to.</t>
            <t>A variable can have a default value, in which case the assumption is that excluding this variable from a request has the same effect as including it with the default value. Since Interaction Descriptions are runtime concepts, however, there is not guarantee that a service might not use a different value between the time when the Interaction Description was retrieved, and the time when a request based on it is being sent.</t>
            <t>Variable descriptions can optionally add documentation and/or appinfo elements to add human- or machine-readable descriptions.</t>

Maybe move form "uri-template" link relation to "interaction-template" link relation in that case?</t>

                  <t>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by and/or can be described by URI Templates. RFC 6570 says that "a URI Template is a compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource Identifiers through variable expansion."  This specification defines Template Descriptions, a schema and a media type that can be used to document and describe a URI Template by supporting descriptive markup that allows variables to be associated with documentation (human-oriented) and/or descriptions (machine- oriented). Template Descriptions can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek to make URI Templates self-describing, without having to create their own representation.</t>
