                    Identifying Profiles on the Web
                       draft-wilde-rfc6906bis-00

Abstract

   Profiles are a way to refine an existing media type so that the
   original semantics are not affected, but to represent the fact that
   the media type now adheres to additional constraints (extensions and/
   or limitations of the media type).  Any representation that conforms
   to a profile also conforms to the original media type.  Profiles were
   introduced in RFC 6906, which defined a link relation type and
   suggested that media types should support a profile parameter.  This
   specification obsoletes the original text with some clarifications,
   and also introduces a registered HTTP preference for profiles, which
   allows profiles to be negotiated without the need for a profile media
   type parameter.

1.  Introduction

   Profiles were introduced by RFC 6906 [RFC6906] as a way to represent
   additional semantics for existing media types.  The original
   specification defined a link relation type for indicating the
   presence of a profile, and also suggested for media types to consider
   supporting profile parameters.

   Experience has shown that both approaches are not ideal.  A link
   relation type typically implies a traversable link, while a profile
   "link" is intended to be an identifier only.  A media type parameter
   must be defined by a media type itself, and so far only very few
   media types support a parameter for representing profile information.
   As a way to improve this situation, this updated specification adds a
   new way to represent profile information at the HTTP level
   (Section Section 4).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Profiles

   The concept of a profile has no strict definition on the Internet or
   on the web.  For the purpose of this specification, a profile can be
   described as additional constraints that can be used to process a
   resource representation, such as structural constraints, conventions,
   extensions, or any other aspects that do not alter the basic media
   type semantics.  A profile MUST NOT change the basic semantics of the
   resource representation (as defined by the media type) when processed
   without profile knowledge, so that clients both with and without
   knowledge of a profiled resource can safely use the same
   representation.

   An easy way to conceptualize profiles is to imagine both a media type
   and a profile having a schema (even though none of them need to have
   one).  If the profile schema is a refinement/augmentation of the
   media type schema, and if any valid profile instance is a valid media
   type instance, then the profile indeed is one according to the
   working definition used in this specification.

   While this specification associates profiles with resource
   representations, creators and users of profiles MAY define and manage
   them in a way that allows them to be used across media types; thus,
   they could be associated with various representations of a resource
   (i.e., using the same profile URI for different media types).
   However, such a design is outside of the scope of this specification,
   and clients SHOULD treat profiles as always being associated with a
   resource representation (i.e., media types).

   Profiles can be combined, meaning that a single resource
   representation can conform to zero or any number of profiles.
   Depending on the profile support of clients, it is possible that the
   same resource representation, when linked to a number of profiles,
   can be processed with different sets of processing rules, based on
   the profile support of individual clients.

   Profiles are identified by URI.  However, as is the case with, for
   example, XML namespace URIs, the URI in this case only serves as an
   identifier, meaning that the presence of a specific URI has to be
   sufficient for a client to assert that a resource representation
   conforms to a profile.  Thus, clients SHOULD treat profile URIs as
   identifiers and not as links, but profiles MAY be defined in a way

   that the URIs do identify retrievable profile descriptions and thus
   can be accessed by clients by dereferencing the profile URI.  For
   profiles intended for use in environments where clients may encounter
   unknown profile URIs, profile maintainers SHOULD consider to make the
   profile URI dereferencable and provide useful documentation at that
   URI.  The design and representation of such profile descriptions,
   however, is outside the scope of this specification.

4.  Profiles and HTTP

   The original profile specification [RFC6906] suggested that media
   types should consider supporting a profile media type parameter.  The
   idea was that this would make the profile visible on the HTTP level,
   and ideally even negotiable.  However, this also meant that it was
   the media type's responsibility to support such a parameter, and
   since media types are typically widely used and long lived, only very
   few support such a media type parameter.

   The HTTP Prefer header [RFC7240] introduces a mechanism where clients
   and servers can communicate preferences, without binding those to the
   media type.  Specifically, the header is based on a registry which
   allows new preferences to be registered, so that new preferences can
   be defined and then exchanged, based on that header.  This means that
   preferences can be exchanged in a way which is independent from the
   media type.  One way to use this mechanism, as described in
   Section Section 6.2, is to define a preference that represents
   profile information.

   Using the HTTP Prefer header, profile information becomes readily
   accessible at the HTTP level, without the need for the media type to
   support or even know the notion of profiles.

6.1.  Link Relation Type

   This specification updates the "Link Relation Type" registry entry
   for "profile" in Web Linking [RFC8288] to refer to this document.

      Description: Identifying that a resource representation conforms
      to a certain profile, without affecting the non-profile semantics
      of the resource representation.

      Reference: RFC XXXX

      Notes: Profile URIs are primarily intended to be used as
      identifiers, and thus clients SHOULD NOT indiscriminately access
      profile URIs.

6.2.  HTTP Preference

   The HTTP Preference below has been registered by IANA per Section 5.1
   of RFC 7240 [RFC7240]:

      Preference: profile
