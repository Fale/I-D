1.  Introduction

   The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple JSON-based
   document format that combines general-purpose JSON data
   representation with conventions about how to represent links.  It
   defines a separation of links and data, supports embedded resources,
   and also supports a shortcut mechanism so that links that use link
   relations identified by URIs can use a shorthand notation.

   HAL has seen quite a bit of adoption as a general-purpose hypermedia
   format, and that can be in part attributed to its simplicity.
   However, because of this simplicity it allows client-side behavior
   which has implications for the interpretation of link relation
   identifiers.  It allows those identifiers to be interpreted in more
   than one way, which results in clients having a different
   interpretation of the hyperlinks, resulting in differing resource
   semantics based on which of the allowed methods clients implement.

   In scenarios where it is required that clients end up with a
   consistent interpretation of the hyperlinks, such as when for example
   Web Linking [RFC8288] is part of the picture and hyperlinks should be
   consistently identified by either registered relation types (simple
   strings) or extension relation types (URIs), it is possible to define
   and use a subset of HAL that is avoids those mechanisms that
   introduce semantic ambiguity.

   This memo defines a subset of HAL which is technically defined as a
   profile [RFC6906] which can be identified by a media type parameter
   and/or a property in the HAL representation itself.  This subset is
   called WebHAL and is specifically intended to work well in scenarios
   where Web Linking is in use, and where the representation of
   hyperlinks should be free of any ambiguities.
