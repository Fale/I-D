        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t>The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple JSON-based document format that combines general-purpose JSON data representation with conventions about how to represent links. It defines a separation of links and data, supports embedded resources, and also supports a shortcut mechanism so that links that use link relations identified by URIs can use a shorthand notation.</t>
            <t>HAL has seen quite a bit of adoption as a general-purpose hypermedia format, and that can be in part attributed to its simplicity. However, because of this simplicity it allows client-side behavior which has implications for the interpretation of link relation identifiers. It allows those identifiers to be interpreted in more than one way, which results in clients having a different interpretation of the hyperlinks, resulting in differing resource semantics based on which of the allowed methods clients implement.</t>
            <t>In scenarios where it is required that clients end up with a consistent interpretation of the hyperlinks, such as when for example Web Linking <xref target="RFC8288"/> is part of the picture and hyperlinks should be consistently identified by either registered relation types (simple strings) or extension relation types (URIs), it is possible to define and use a subset of HAL that is avoids those mechanisms that introduce semantic ambiguity.</t>
            <t>This memo defines a subset of HAL which is technically defined as a profile <xref target="RFC6906"/> which can be identified by a media type parameter and/or a property in the HAL representation itself. This subset is called WebHAL and is specifically intended to work well in scenarios where Web Linking is in use, and where the representation of hyperlinks should be free of any ambiguities.</t>

                    <abstract><t>This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type that allows resource representations to indicate that they are following one or more profiles.  A profile is defined not to alter the semantics of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients to learn about additional semantics (constraints, conventions, extensions) that are associated with the resource representation, in addition to those defined by the media type and possibly other mechanisms.</t></abstract>
