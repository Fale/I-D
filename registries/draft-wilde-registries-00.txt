                         The Use of Registries
                       draft-wilde-registries-00

Abstract

   Registries on the Internet and the Web fulfill a wide range of tasks,
   ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type
   identifiers, all the way to application-level protocols and
   standards.  This document summarizes some of the reasons of why and
   how to use registries, and how some of them are operated.  It serves
   as a informative reference for specification writers considering
   whether to create and manage a registry, allowing them to better
   understand some of the issues associated with certain design
   discussions.

1.  Introduction

   Technologies and standards in computer networking have long used the
   concept of a "Registry" as a place where well-known information is
   available and managed.  In most case, the main reason to use a
   registry is to create a technology or standard that has stable parts
   (the technology/standard itself), as well as some parts that are
   supposed to evolve, even though the technology/standard itself
   remains stable and unchanged.

   A registry essentially is a pattern of how to separate those two
   aspects of a technology/standard, allowing the technology/standard to

   remain stable, while the parts of it referencing the registry can
   evolve over time by changing the registry contents.  For
   specification writers, this has proven to be a useful and successful
   pattern.  The "Protocol Registries" maintained by the "Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)" have steadily increased in number,
   at the time of writing (January 2016), the [4] contains 1903
   individual registries.  This number indicates that registries as a
   "protocol specification pattern" are quite popular and successful.

   Deciding if a specification should use a registry is not an easy
   task.  It involves identifying those parts that should be kept stable
   (in the specification itself), and those that should be managed in
   one or more registries for ongoing management and evolution.  Even
   after identifying this split, it is necessary to define how exactly
   the registry part(s) should be managed, involving questions such as
   submission procedures, review processes, revocation/change
   management, and access to the registry contents for the worldwide
   developer community.

   This document is intended to provide an overview to specification
   developers in terms of why, when, and how to use registries.  It is
   not meant to provide definitive guidance, but more intended as a
   reference to consider the different ways in which the general
   "registry pattern" can be used, and what the possible side-effects on
   some of these solutions may be.
