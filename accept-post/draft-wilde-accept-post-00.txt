Internet-Draft                 Accept-Post                     July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a new HTTP response header field Accept-
   Post, which indicates server support for specific media types for
   entity bodies in HTTP POST requests.  This header field is comparable
   to the Accept-Patch response header field specified together with the
   HTTP PATCH method [4].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  The Accept-Post Response Header Field

   This specification introduces a new response header field Accept-Post
   used to specify the document formats accepted by the server in HTTP
   POST requests.  Accept-Post SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for
   any resource that supports the use of the POST method.  The presence
   of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit
   indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the
   Request-URI.  The presence of a specific document format in this
   header indicates that that specific format is allowed on the resource
   identified by the Request-URI.

   The syntax for Accept-Post headers, using the ABNF syntax defined in
   Section 2.1 of RFC 2616 [2], is given by the following definition.
   Accept-Post = "Accept-Post" ":" 1#media-type

   The Accept-Post header specifies a comma-separated listing of media-
   types (with optional parameters) as defined by RFC 2616 [2], Section
   3.7.


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  The Accept-Post Response Header

   The Accept-Post response header should be added to the permanent
   registry of message header fields (see [3]).


5.  Examples

   Accept-Post extends the way in which interaction information can be

   exposed in HTTP itself.  The following sections contain some examples
   how this can be used in concrete HTTP-based services.

5.1.  Linked Data Platform

   The Linked Data Platform (LDP) [5] describes a set of best practices
   and simple approach for a read-write Linked Data architecture, based
   on HTTP access to Web resources that describe their state using the
   RDF data model.  LDP defines LDP Containers (LDPC) and LDP Resources
   (LDPR).  Adding new LDPRs to an LDPC is done by sending an HTTP POST
   request to the LDPC.  An LDPC can constrain the media types it is
   accepting for these POST requests, and MUST expose its support for
   accepted media types via Accept-Post.

   In fact, the Accept-Post header has been developed within the LDP
   Working Group (LPDWG) Appendix A, and it was then decided that the
   header itself might be useful in other contexts as well, and thus
   should be specified in a standalone document.

5.2.  Atom Publishing Protocol

   The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) [6] defines a model of
   interacting with collections and members, based on representations
   using the Atom [7] syntax.  AtomPub allows clients to create new
   collection members by using HTTP POST, with the request being sent to
   the collection URI.  AtomPub servers can limit the media types they
   accept in these POST requests, and the accepted media types are
   listed in an "AtomPub service document".

   The Accept-Post header field does allow an AtomPub server to
   advertise its support for specific media types in interactions with
   the collection resource, without the need for a client to locate the
   service document and interact with it.  This increases the visibility
   of the "POST to Create" model of AtomPub, and makes it easier for
   clients to find out about the capabilities of a specific collection.

   While the AtomPub protocol cannot be changed retroactively, this
   additional way of exposing interaction guidance could make it easier
   for clients to interact with AtomPub services that do support the
   Accept-Post header field.  For those that do not support Accept-Post,
   clients would still have to rely on using the information contained
   in the service document (including the sometimes tricky issue of how
   to locate the service document for a given collection).

5.3.  Additional Information in Error Responses

   If a client POSTs an unsupported POST document, it is possible for
   the server to use Accept-Post to indicate the supported media types.

   These can be specified using a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response
   when the client sends a POST document format that the server does not
   support for the resource identified by the Request-URI.  Such a
   response then MAY include an Accept-Post response header notify the
   client what POST document media types are supported.


6.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982 [8].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
