			<t>This memo specifies the Universal Resource Identifier (URI) scheme "sms" for specifying a recipient (and optionally a gateway) for an SMS message. SMS messages are two-way paging messages that can be sent from and received by a mobile phone or a suitably equipped computer.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>Compliant software MUST follow this specification. The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
			<section title="What is GSM?">
				<t>GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a digital mobile phone standard which is used extensively in many parts of the world. First named after its frequency band around 900 MHz, GSM-900 has provided the basis for several other networks utilizing GSM technology, in particular GSM networks operating in the frequency bands around 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz. When referring to "GSM" in this document, we mean any of these GSM-based networks that operate a short message service.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="What is SMS?" anchor="sms-descr">
				<t>The Short Message Service (SMS) <xref target="SMS"/> is an integral part of the GSM network technology. It has been very successful and currently is a major source of revenue for many GSM operators. SMS as a service is so successful that other Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) technologies have adapted it as well, in particular the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). Because of this development, this memo uses the term "SMS client" to refer to user agents who are able to send and/or receive SMS messages.</t>
				<section title="SMS content">
					<t>GSM SMS messages are alphanumeric paging messages that can be sent to and from SMS clients. SMS messages have a maximum length of 160 characters (7-bit characters from the GSM character set <xref target="SMS-CHAR"/>), or 140 octets. Other character sets (such as UCS-2 16-bit characters, resulting in 70 character messages) MAY also be supported <xref target="SMS-CHAR"/>, but are defined as being OPTIONAL by the SMS specification. Consequently, applications handling SMS messages as part of a chain of character processing applications MUST make sure that character sets are correctly mapped to and from the character set used for SMS messages.</t>
					<t>While the 160 character variety for SMS messages is by far the most widely used one, there are numerous other content types for SMS messages, such as small bitmaps ("operator logos") and simple formats for musical notes ("ring tones"). However, these formats are proprietary and are not considered in this memo.</t>
					<t>SMS messages are very limited in length (140 octets), and the first versions of the SMS specification did not specify any standardized methods for concatenating SMS messages. As a consequence, several proprietary methods were invented, but the current SMS specification does specify message concatenation. In order to deal with this situation, SMS clients composing messages SHOULD use the standard concatenation method based on the header in the TP-User Data field as specified in the SMS specification <xref target="SMS"/>. When sending a message to an SMS recipient whose support for concatenated messages is unknown, the SMS client MAY opt to use the backwards-compatible (text-based) concatenation method defined in the SMS specification <xref target="SMS"/>. Proprietary concatenation methods SHOULD NOT be used except in closed systems, where the capabilities of the recipient(s) are always known.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="SMS infrastructure">
					<t>SMS messages can be transmitted over an SMS client's network interface using the signaling channels of the underlying GSTN infrastructure, so there is no delay for call setup. Alternatively, SMS messages MAY be submitted through other front-ends (for example Web services), which makes it possible for SMS clients to run on computers which are not directly connected to a GSTN network supporting SMS.</t>
					<t>SMS messages sent with the GSTN SMS service MUST be sent as class 1 SMS messages, if the client is able to specify the message class.</t>
					<section title="SMS Centers" anchor="smscenter">
						<t>SMS messages are stored by an entity called SMS Center (SMSC), and sent to the recipient when the subscriber connects to the network. The number of a cooperative SMSC must be known to the SMS sender (i.e., the entity submitting the SMS message to a GSTN infrastructure) when sending the message (usually, the SMSC's number is configured in the SMS client and specific for the network operator to which the sender has subscribed). In most situations, the SMSC number is part of the sending SMS client's configuration. However, in some special cases (such as when the SMS recipient only accepts messages from a certain SMSC), it may be necessary to send the SMS message over a specific SMSC.</t>
						<t>Short messages can be mobile terminated (MT) or mobile originated (MO). MT messages are the ones that arrive at SMS clients; MO messages are sent by SMS clients. Networks may support either, both, or none of these. For the purpose of this memo, it is important that the sending SMS client is allowed to submit MO messages, and that the receiver is allowed to receive MT messages.</t>
						<t>The exact setup of message submission and delivery is not subject of this memo, it may incorporate additional hops in addition to the pure SMS transport. For example, the sending SMS client may use a Web service to submit the SMS message, and the receiving SMS client may be set up to forward the SMS to an email account. For the purpose of this memo, it is important that the receiver can be addressed by a GSTN number, and that the sender can submit an SMS message using this number.</t>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section title="SMS Telematic Interworking" anchor="teleinter">
					<t>While in most cases SMS messages are exchanged between SMS clients, the SMS specification also includes provisions for so-called "Telematic Interworking". In this scenario, the SMS message specifies a Protocol Identifier, which identifies the service to which the SMS message has to be submitted. In effect, this implements a gateway functionality in the SMSC.</t>
					<t>Telematic Interworking supports a number of services from Fax through Telex and Internet Email up to voice telephone, where the gateway is expected to make a text-to-speech transformation. The set of possible services is defined by the SMS specification <xref target="SMS"/>, but network operators are not required to support any of these services. SMS clients SHOULD implement support for Telematic Interworking, which among other things means that users must be able to set the Protocol Identifier field of generated SMS messages. If clients support Telematic Interworking, they MUST indicate to the user the changed semantics of the receiver number (e.g., if Fax is selected, the receiver will be contacted via Fax rather than SMS).</t>
					<t>In the following list the telematic devices (i.e., the services that can be addressed using the Telematic Interworking mechanism) defined by the SMS specification are described. The abbreviations are not taken from the SMS specification, but are introduced by this memo for identifying the device type using an SMS service qualifier keyword.</t>
					<t>
						<list style="hanging">
							<t hangText='"IMPL":'>In this case the device type is implicitly defined, either because the SMS Center knows it, or because it can be concluded on the basis of the address.</t>
							<t hangText='"TELEX":'>Telex device</t>
							<t hangText='"G3FAX":'>Group 3 telefax device</t>
							<t hangText='"G4FAX":'>Group 4 telefax device</t>

							<t hangText='"VIDEOTEX":'>Videotex</t>
							<t hangText="teletex:">Teletex, either with an unspecified carrier or using PSPDN, CSPDN, PSTN, or ISDN as carrier</t>

							<t hangText='"MH":'>Some message handling facility known to the SMS center (not further specified)</t>
							<t hangText="x400:">X.400-based message handling system</t>
							<t>The SMS specification fails to specify how X.400 OR addresses are actually embedded into SMS messages, so even though there is a Protocol Identifier for X.400, it is impossible to encode the recipient(s) of a message.</t>
							<t hangText="email:">Internet electronic mail</t>
							<t>The recipient(s) of SMS messages gatewayed to Internet electronic mail are specified in the message's user data in a way defined by the SMS specification.</t>
							<t hangText="specific:">7 combinations are defined to have a meaning specific to each SMS center, their usage is based on mutual agreement between SMS clients and the SMS center.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>It is important to notice that some of the above devices require additional information to be specified (in particular, the "Internet electronic mail" format). The SMS specification defines the methods how this has to be done (effectively by embedding the email information into the SMS message's text).</t>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section title="Universal Resource Identifiers">
				<t>One of the core specifications for identifying resources on the Internet is RFC 3986 <xref target="RFC3986"/>, specifying the syntax and semantics of a Universal Resource Identifier (URI). The most important notion of URIs are "schemes", which define a framework within which resources can be uniquely identified and addressed. URIs enable users to access resources, and are used for very diverse schemes such as access protocols (HTTP, FTP), broadcast media (TV channels <xref target="RFC2838"/>), messaging (email <xref target="RFC2368"/>), and even telephone numbers (voice <xref target="RFC3966"/>).</t>
				<t>URIs often are mentioned together with Universal Resource Names (URNs) and/or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and it often is unclear how to separate these concepts. For the purpose of this memo, only the term URI will be used, referring to the most fundamental concept. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has issued a note <xref target="uri-clarification"/> discussing the topic of URIs, URNs, and URLs in detail.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="SMS Messages and the Internet">
				<t>One of the important reasons for the universal access of the Web is the ability to access all information through a unique interface. This kind of integration makes it easy to provide information as well as to consume it. One aspect of this integration is the support of user agents (in the case of the Web, commonly referred to as browsers) for multiple content formats (such as HTML, GIF, JPEG) and access schemes (such as HTTP, HTTP-S, FTP).</t>
				<t>The "mailto" scheme has proven to be very useful and popular, because most user agents support it by providing an email composition facility when the user selects (e.g., clicks on) the URI. Similarly, the "sms" scheme can be supported by user agents by providing an SMS message composition facility when the user selects the URI. In cases where the user agent does not provide a built-in SMS message composition facility, the scheme could still be supported by opening a Web page which provides such a service. The specific Web page to be used could be configured by the user, so that each user could use the SMS message composition service of his choice.</t>
				<t>The goal of this memo is to specify the "sms" URI scheme, so that user agents (such as Web browsers and email clients) could start to support it. The "sms" URI scheme identifies SMS message endpoints as resources. When "sms" URIs are dereferenced, implementations MAY create a message and present it to be edited before being sent, or they MAY use additional services to provide the functionality necessary for composing a message and sending it to the SMS message endpoint.</t>
				<section title="SMS Messages and the Web">
					<t>SMS messages can provide an alternative to "mailto" URIs <xref target="RFC2368"/>, or "tel" or "fax" URIs <xref target="RFC3966"/>. When a "sms" URI is activated, the user agent MAY start a program for sending an SMS message, just as "mailto" may open a mail client. Unfortunately, most browsers do not support the external handling of internally unsupported URI schemes in the same generalized way as most of them support external handling of content for MIME types which they do not support internally. Ideally, user agents should implement generic URI parsers and provide a way to associate unsupported schemes with external applications (or Web services).</t>
					<t>The recipient of an SMS message need not be a mobile phone. It can be a server that can process SMS messages, either by gatewaying them to another messaging system (such as regular electronic mail), or by parsing them for supplementary services.</t>
					<t>SMS messages can be used to transport almost any kind of data (even though there is a very tight size limit), but the only standardized data formats are character-based messages in different character encodings. SMS messages have a maximum length of 160 characters (when using 7-bit characters from the SMS character set), or 140 octets. However, SMS messages can be concatenated to form longer messages. It is up to the user agent to decide whether to limit the length of the message, and how to indicate this limit in its user interface, if necessary. There is one exception to this, see <xref target="htmlforms"/>.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="SMS Messages and Forms">
					<t>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) <xref target="HTML401"/> provides a way to collect information from a user and pass it to a server for processing. This functionality is known as "HTML forms". A filled-in form is usually sent to the destination using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or email. However, SMS messages can also be used as the transport mechanism for these forms. As SMS transport is "out-of-band" as far as normal HTTP over TCP/IP is concerned, this provides a way to fill in forms offline, and send the data without making a TCP connection to the server, as the set-up time, cost, and overhead for a TCP connection are large compared to an SMS message. Also, depending on the network configuration, the sender's telephone number may be included in the SMS message, thus providing a weak form of authentication.</t>

		<section title='The "sms" URI Scheme' anchor="uri-syntax">
			<t>Syntax definitions are given using the Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications <xref target="RFC4234"/>.</t>
			<section title="Applicability">
				<t>This URI scheme is intended for sending an SMS message to certain recipient(s). The functionality is quite similar to that of the "mailto" URI, which (as per RFC 2368 <xref target="RFC2368"/>) can also be used with a comma-separated list of email addresses.</t>
				<t>In some situations, it may be necessary to guide the sender to send the SMS message via a certain SMS Center (SMSC). For this purpose, the URI may specify the number of a specific SMSC.</t>
				<t>SMS messages may be sent through gateways to other services. These gateways are operated inside SMS centers. An "sms" URI may specify that a certain gateway should be used.</t>
				<t>The notation for phone numbers is taken from <xref target="RFC3966"/>. Refer to this document for information on why this particular format was chosen.</t>
				<t>How the SMS message is sent to the SMSC is outside the scope of this specification. SMS messages can be sent over the GSM air interface, by using a modem and a suitable protocol, or by accessing services over other protocols, such as a Web service for sending SMS messages. Also, SMS message service options like deferred delivery and delivery notification requests are not within the scope of this document. Such services MAY be requested from the network by the user agent if necessary.</t>
				<t>SMS messages sent as a result of this URI MUST be sent as class 1 SMS messages, if the user agent is able to specify the message class.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Formal Definition" anchor="syntaxdef">
				<t>The URI scheme's keywords specified in the following syntax description are case-insensitive. The syntax of an "sms" URI is formally described as follows, where the URI base syntax is taken from RFC 3986 <xref target="RFC3986"/>:</t>
				<t>

                   ( "UNSPEC" / "PSPDN" / "CSPDN" / "PSTN" / "ISDN" )
email           =  "SMTP:" address
reserved        =  "RES" ( "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" ) 
specific        =  "SPEC" ( "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" )</artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>Some illustrative examples using this syntax are given in <xref target="uri-examples"/>.</t>
				<t>The syntax definition for "phonedigit" is taken from RFC 3966 <xref target="RFC3966"/>.</t>
				<t>The syntax definition for "query" is taken from RFC 3986 <xref target="RFC3986"/>, please refer to that document.</t>
				<t>The "sms-body" is used to define the body of the SMS message to be composed. It consists of percent-encoded UTF-8 characters. Implementations MUST make sure that the sms-body characters are converted to a suitable character encoding before sending, the most popular being the 7-bit SMS character encoding, another variant (though not as universally supported as 7-bit SMS) is the UCS-2 character encoding  (both specified in <xref target="SMS-CHAR"/>). Implementations MAY choose to discard (or convert) characters in the sms-body that are not supported by the SMS character set they are using to send the SMS message. If they do discard or convert characters, they MUST notify the user.</t>
				<t>It should be noted that both the SMSC as well as the PID qualifier may appear only once per sms-recipient. If multiple SMSC or PID qualifiers are present, conforming software MUST interpret the first occurrence and ignore all other occurrences.</t>
			</section>
			<section title='Processing an "sms" URI' anchor="processing">
				<t>The following list describes the steps for processing an "sms" URI:</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>The "gstn-phone" of the first "sms-recipient" is extracted. It is the phone number of the final recipient and it MUST be written in international form with country code, unless the number only works from inside a certain geographical area or a network. Note that some numbers may work from several networks but not from the whole world - these SHOULD be written in international form. According to RFC 3966 <xref target="RFC3966"/>, all international numbers MUST begin with a "+" character. Hyphens, dots, and parentheses (referred to as "visual separators" in RFC 3966) are used only to improve readability and MUST NOT convey any other meaning.</t>
						<t>The "smsc-qualifier" of the first "sms-recipient" is extracted, if present.</t>
						<t>The "pid-qualifier" of the first "sms-recipient" is extracted, if present.</t>
						<t>The "sms-body" is extracted, if present.</t>
						<t>The user agent should provide some means for message composition, either by implementing this itself, or by accessing a service providing it. Message composition SHOULD start with the body extracted from the "sms-body", if present. If the "pid-qualifier" is set to "pid=SMTP:...", then the user agent must make sure that the email address is correctly set (as defined by the SMS specification <xref target="SMS"/>) in the message being composed.</t>
						<t>After message composition, a user agent SHOULD try to send the message first using the SMSC set in the "smsc-qualifier" (if present). If that fails, the user agent MAY try another SMSC.</t>
						<t>If the URI consists of a comma-separated list of recipients (i.e., contains multiple "sms-recipient" parts), all of them are processed in this manner. Exactly the same message SHOULD be sent to all of the listed recipients.</t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Examples of Use" anchor="uri-examples">
				<t>
					<figure>
						<artwork>sms:+41796431851</artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>This indicates an SMS message capable recipient at the given telephone number. The message is sent using the user agent's default SMSC.</t>
				<t>
					<figure>
						<artwork>sms:+41796431851;smsc=+41794999000</artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>This indicates that the SMS message should be sent using the SMSC at the given number.</t>
				<t>
					<figure>
						<artwork>sms:+41796431851,+4116321035;pid=fax</artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>This URI should result in two SMS messages being sent, one to the recipient number as shown in the example above, the other one being sent as a fax to the second number (the fax is sent by the SMSC performing the gatewaying, not by the user agent).</t>
				<t>
					<figure>
						<artwork>sms:+41796431851;pid=smtp:dret@berkeley.edu?body=hello%20there</artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>In this case, a message (initially being set to "hello there", which may have been modified by the user before sending) will be sent via SMS using the SMS to email functionality in the SMSC, so that it will eventually result in an email being sent to the specified email address. In this case, interpretation of the phone number is left to the SMSC, and is typically not used if the delivery of the email is done with SMTP or some other email delivery mechanism.</t>
			</section>
			<section title='Using "sms" URIs in HTML Forms' anchor="htmlforms">
				<t>When using a "sms" type URI as an action URI for HTML form submission <xref target="HTML401"/>, the form contents MUST be packaged in the SMS message just as they are packaged when using a "mailto" URI <xref target="RFC2368"/>, using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" MIME type, effectively packaging all form data into URI compliant syntax <xref target="RFC3986"/>. The SMS message MUST NOT contain any HTTP headers, only the form data. The MIME type is implicit. It MUST NOT be transferred in the SMS message.</t>
				<t>The character encoding used for form submissions MUST be UTF-8 <xref target="RFC2279"/>. It should be noted, however, that user agents MUST percent-encode form submissions before sending them.</t>
				<t>The user agent SHOULD inform the user about the possible security hazards involved when submitting the form (it is probably being sent as plain text over an air interface).</t>
				<t>If the form submission is longer than the maximum SMS message size, the user agent MAY either concatenate SMS messages, if it is able to do so, or it MAY refuse to send the message. The user agent MUST NOT send out partial form submissions.</t>
				<t>Form submission via an "sms" URI can be combined with Telematic Interworking to result in form submissions being submitted via an SMS message and finally being sent to an email account. In this case, all provisions for using the email "pid-qualifier" and using "sms" URIs with HTML forms must be followed.</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title='"sms" URIs and SMS Web Services' anchor="smsservice">
			<t>In many cases, user agents will not be able to directly compose and send SMS messages (because this requires that such a service is accessible to the system the user agent is running on). However, it is likely that the user has access to a Web service that provides an SMS service, such as a Web site offering form-based SMS composition. Ideally, the user agent should access this Web service when activating an "sms" URI, thus enabling the user to use the Web service.</t>
			<t>One problem with this approach is that the Web service should somehow get the "sms" URI, in order to interpret it and set the required parameters (such as the receiver's phone number). The easiest way to implement this is for the user agent to add the "sms" URI as query string to the Web service's URI. Consequently, user agents supporting SMS Web services identified by URIs SHOULD append the "sms" URI as query string to the Web services URI when accessing the Web service. Web services providing SMS composition facilities SHOULD expect to receive an "sms" URI as query string and should process it as described by this memo. This method only can be applied for Web service URIs which permit query strings (such as "http" and "https" URIs). For other Web service URIs (such as "ftp" and "mailto"), user agents as well as Web services MUST NOT use the query string.</t>
			<t>It should be noted that RFC 3986 <xref target="RFC3986"/> defines that within query strings, the "gen-delims" characters ":", "/", "?", "#", "[", "]", and "@" are reserved. It is therefore necessary to encode the "sms" URI accordingly before appending it as query string.</t>
			<section title="Example">
				<t>A document contains this fragment of (X)HTML:</t>
				<t>
					<figure>
						<artwork>&lt;a href="sms:+41796431851">Send me an SMS!&lt;/a></artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>The user agent interpreting this document does not internally support SMS message composition or sending, but has been configured to access a Web service for handling "sms" URIs. This Web service has the following URI:</t>
				<t>
					<figure>
						<artwork>http://sms.example.com/sms-form</artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>When the user activates the "sms" URI (e.g., by clicking on the text "Send me an SMS!"), the user agent sends a request to the SMS Web service and acts as if the activated URI had been:</t>
				<t>
					<figure>
						<artwork>http://sms.example.com/sms-form?sms%3A+41796431851</artwork>
					</figure>
				</t>
				<t>The SMS Web service is then responsible for parsing the query string and providing an appropriate interface, for example by already filling in the recipient address with the number provided by the "sms" URI. This way, the non-SMS capable user agent and the SMS Web service can interact to provide the best integration of Web browsing and SMS messaging to the user.</t>

		<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
			<t>SMS messages are transported without any provisions for privacy or integrity, so SMS users should be aware of these inherent security problems of SMS messages. Unlike electronic mail, where additional mechanisms exist to layer security features on top of the basic infrastructure, there currently is no such framework for SMS messages.</t>
			<t>SMS messages very often are delivered almost instantaneously (if the receiving SMS client is online), but there is no guarantee for when SMS messages will be delivered. In particular, SMS messages between different network operators sometimes take a long time to be delivered (hours or even days) or are not delivered at all, so applications SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the reliability and performance of SMS message transmission.</t>
			<t>In most networks, sending SMS messages is not a free service. Therefore, SMS clients MUST make sure that any action that incurs costs is acknowledged by the end user, unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the end user. If an SMS client has different ways of submitting an SMS message (such as a Web service and a phone line), then the end user MUST have a way to control which way is chosen.</t>
			<t>SMS clients often are limited devices (typically mobile phones), and the sending SMS client SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the receiving SMS client supporting any non-standard services, such as proprietary message concatenation or proprietary content types. However, if the sending SMS client has prior knowledge about the receiving SMS client, then he MAY use this knowledge to compose non-standard SMS messages.</t>
			<t>There are certain special SMS messages defined in the SMS specification <xref target="SMS"/> that can be used, for example, to turn on indicators on the phone display, or to send data to certain communication ports (comparable to UDP ports) on the device. Certain proprietary systems (for example, the Wireless Application Protocol <xref target="WAP"/>) define configuration messages that may be used to reconfigure the devices remotely. Any SMS client SHOULD make sure that malicious use of such messages is not possible, for example by filtering out certain SMS User Data headers. Gateways that accept SMS messages e.g. in e-mail messages or Web forms and pass them on to an SMSC, SHOULD implement this kind of 'firewalling' approach as well.</t>
			<t>Because the narrow bandwidth of the SMS communications channel, there should also be checks in place for excessively long concatenated messages. As an example, it may take two minutes to transfer thirty concatenated text messages.</t>
			<t>Unchecked input from a user MUST NOT be used to populate any other fields in a SMS message other than the User Data field (not including the User Data Header field). All other parts, including the User Data Header, of the short message should only be generated by trusted means.</t>
			<t>By including SMS URIs in unsolicited messages (a.k.a. "spam") or other types of advertising, the originator of the SMS URIs may attempt to reveal an individual's phone number and/or to link the identity (i.e., e-mail address) used for messaging with the identity (i.e., phone number) used for the mobile phone. This attempt to collect information may be a privacy issue, and user agents may make users aware of that risk before composing or sending SMS messages. Users agents which do not provide any feedback about this privacy issue make users more vulnerable to this kind of attack.</t>
			<t>A user agent SHOULD NOT send out SMS messages without the knowledge of the user, because of associated risks, which include sending masses of SMS messages to a subscriber without his consent, and the costs involved in sending an SMS message.</t>
			<t>The user agent SHOULD have some mechanism that the user can use to filter out unwanted destinations for SMS messages. The user agent SHOULD also have some means of restricting the number of SMS messages being sent as the result of activating one "sms" URI.</t>
			<t>If an "sms" URI contains a pid-qualifier and the user agent supports the qualifier and its value, then the user agent MUST set the SMS message's PID as specified by the qualifier. User agents MAY inform users about the value and the functional consequences of PID qualifiers (e.g., by notifying users that sending the SMS effectively will result in a fax message being delivered, rather than an SMS message).</t>
			<t>The method described in <xref target="smsservice"/> ("sms" URIs and SMS Web Services) adds another level of indirection to the handling of "sms" URIs. If this method is combined with the pid-qualifier gateway functionality, SMS composition and reception will probably be distributed over three different protocols (the Web service, SMS transport itself, and the service selected by the pid-qualifier). User agents SHOULD make this clear to users (either when the Web service is being configured, or when it is accessed).</t>
			<t>The Telematic Interworking functionality of the SMSC addressed by the pid-qualifier is not necessarily implemented by the SMSC being used, and SMSC providers are known for not or not correctly supporting some or all pid-qualifier values. User agents SHOULD take into account that the success rate of SMS messages being sent using pid-qualifiers is lower than that of "plain" SMS messages.</t>
			<t>As suggested functionality, the user agent MAY offer a possibility for the user to filter out those gstn-phone numbers that are expressed in local format, as most premium-rate numbers are expressed in local format, and because determining the correct local context (and hence the validity of the number to this specific user) may be very difficult.</t>
			<t>When using SMS URIs as targets of forms (as described in <xref target="htmlforms"/>), the user agent SHOULD inform the user about the possible security hazards involved when submitting the form (it is probably being sent as plain text over an air interface).</t>
